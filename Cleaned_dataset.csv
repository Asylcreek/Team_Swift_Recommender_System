2,Elijah Okokon,DMatrix,okoelijah@gmail.com,2,7,1,982,2,YOUR HIGH IQ WILL KILL YOUR STARTUP,"<p>In 2004 I was in Brazil, walking down the hill in Lapa to get some lunch. I was with a friend who I had met in the hostel I was staying – his name was Ofer. We were having a discussion about intelligence, and what role it plays in success.</p>
<p>Then out of the side of the road stepped a man. He was holding a knife in one hand and a bottle in the other hand. He spoke to us in fast Portuguese, clearly asking us to hand over the things we held. I stood there, not very sure what to do. Ofer started speaking quickly to the man, telling the man not to rob us.</p>
<p>What you have to know about Ofer is that he had been an Israeli soldier. He hated violence of any form, but he knew how to be violent.</p>
<p>The man threw the bottle on the floor and it broke into pieces, he picked up the bottle and lunged at us. I ran a short distance off, and Ofer stood there and dodged the man, all the while talking to him. The man attacked several times, and each time Ofer just moved aside.</p>
<p>Then finally, Ofer kicked the weapons out of the guys hands, punched him, and he fell. He then told me to run, and we ran down the hill to the restaurant.</p>
<p>We sat there and he continued what we had spoken about. He said: That demonstrates what I mean. The man with the knife did not know how to use that knife. If he had been as trained in knife fighting as I was in hand combat, he would have been able to destroy me. But he had a tool that he felt gave him an advantage, but it’s nothing compared to a person who has no tool, but has worked to develop what he has.</p>
<p>Intelligence is like a knife. If you are intelligent, you are at a clear advantage against people who are not intelligent. But if you are intelligent, and another person is not as intelligent, but the other person is willing to train harder than you, the other person will very quickly overtake you in ability.</p>
<h3><strong>HOW YOUR INTELLIGENCE WILL DESTROY YOU</strong></h3>
<p>People who are born intelligent start off life with everything easy for them. They don’t have to work hard to get good grades; they never really have to do much to get ahead. The major challenge of early life is school – and school is designed for average people. So intelligent people just breeze through.</p>
<p>But there is a point where every intelligent person faces something that requires more than intelligence. It requires hard work, it requires the ability to fail, it requires being able to do tough tasks, boring tasks. For the first time in their life, in spite of their intelligence, these intelligent people are challenged, and they start failing. Like when they first attempt to create a start-up.</p>
<p>And that’s where most of them retreat. They focus on things they can’t fail on, and ignore the other important things. They start to blame other things (like the school system). They procrastinate. They refuse to face new problems because they know they will not be able to handle them, and this does not fit into their worldview that they are invincible.</p>
<p>Let me tell another story. In 2007, I had dinner with the father of my girlfriend in Paris. He is currently a vice president at one of the top 5 consulting companies in the world. He is a Jewish french immigrant from Morocco – he came in the 70s to France with no money and no connections, and he made it up to become Vice President, even though he studied to be an engineer.</p>
<p>I asked him: How did you do it? How did you start from being an immigrant to become executive material? He told me: I got this far because I’m intelligent. He continued: But there were many many people as intelligent as I am who graduated together with me. They are still engineers right now. The difference between me and them is that when I arrived, I knew that I did not have family here in France, I did not have connections. And I knew there were a lot of other people as intelligent as I was, and who had all these advantages. The only way to be successful then would be to gain a slight advantage over them – I had to work and train harder than they did, I had to get to know more people than they did, I had to learn more about more things that they did.</p>
<p>We started off equals, but at some point all the effort I put in started to pay off, and where they stopped improving themselves, I continued, and I got better and better. Where they were afraid to try new things because they would fail, I tried and I got better and knew more, till I was good enough for the job I hold now.</p>
<h2><strong>HOW THIS RELATES TO YOU</strong></h2>
<p>Being intelligent is like having a knife. If you train every day in using the knife, you will be invincible. If you think that just having a knife will make you win any battle you fight, then you will fail. This believe in your own inherent ability is what will kill your start-up. Success comes from the work and ability you put in becoming better than the others, and not from some brilliance you feel you may have within you.</p>
<p>So don’t believe that the brilliance of your idea is what will make you successful. What will make you successful is when you are out there every day, doing something new, challenging yourself, trying new methods, studying new ways, having a lot of small failures, then getting better every day.</p>",,
2,Elijah Okokon,DMatrix,okoelijah@gmail.com,2,7,1,983,2,A CHINESE VILLAGER WHO SELLS MORE SOFTWARE DAILY THAN YOU DO,"<p>I was alone in the center of a small Chinese town, the weakly glowing streetlights hardly illuminating the streets. The silence was heavy and absolute. It was different from the eternal light and sound of Shenzhen, and the high elevation gave the air an unusual taste. Things were not the same up here in the mountains, and this strangeness seemed a bit menacing. The roads had been tarred, courtesy of the rich central government who gave special attention to the Chinese minorities, but the villages up here in the mountains of Yunnan province did not have many cars to wear down the roads. So they felt incomplete, and leaves lay about, their crushing beneath my feet giving my walk a strange soundtrack.</p>
<p>A group of men sat in a doorway smoking tobacco from a big bong, watching me walk past with impassive faces. I hurried a bit. What I was looking for was near, I knew. I turned a corner into a small side street, and saw it – the red and blue glow of the humming fluorescent lights, the pictures of the scantily clad lady with big breasts. I had found the local internet cafe.</p>
<p>I walked in through the narrow doorway, squeezing past a young teenage couple holding hands and staring out of the door. The guy had a scar across his forehead, I wondered idly what their story was, it may have been an amazing love story, it could have been endlessly tragic, perhaps they were completely boring. I’ll never know, because I walked into that room and was hit by the combined glow of hundreds of computer screens, different figures danced across many screens in some dance dance revolution clone, colourful websites reflected off the eyes of engrossed guys, smoking men scrolled through the news, cliques of teens starred together at a screen and shouted and laughed. The room was huge and it was filled with people surfing the internet and playing games. The internet cafe, long thought to be dead, had simply retreated here into the mountains, and it fed the local population with all the entertainment they could not afford to have at home.</p>
<p>After the necessary registration with my passport at the counter, I bought an entire night of internet surfing, starting off by checking what was new at techcrunch. I went through the usual schedule of websites I read, skipping only facebook and twitter, as they don’t work here.</p>
<p>Being the only foreigner in there, I was getting a lot of looks, giggles and yelled out “HELLOs” from the kids around. I expected them to come talk to me at some point, so when someone tapped my shoulder, I was suprised that rather than some spiky haired teenager, it was a somewhat middle-aged smiling man with a cigarette dangling from his lip. He introduced himself with the sentence: “TechCrunch is my favorite website, too”. His english was heavily accented, but good.</p>
<p>I simply looked up at him, unsure what to reply. I didn’t need to say anything, because he started talking to me about the last few articles he had read on TechCrunch. I got only a few sentences in, mostly in agreement with his somewhat unusual but pretty insightful opinions about what they wrote. He spoke as if he had never spoken to anyone about TechCrunch, and needed to get all his thoughts out.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes of mostly listening, he invited me out to have a drink with him and his friends. He excitedly made phone calls in the local dialect and we went out. We walked over to some local food place, and sat outside on plastic chairs, several beers quickly appearing on the table. Soon, several of his friends popped in a shinily new BYD car, and they joined me.</p>
<p>He told me what he does: he sells software. And he sells a lot of software. Every month, he makes more than $5000, which is more than 50 times the average salary where he lives. He told me how he does it, and it’s a bit unusual.</p>
<p>He had learnt how to program from a friend of his. They had both moved to Kunming and started working, but when his dad got sick, he had to go home and farm to keep the family alive. His dad was sick for close to a year, and they needed money. Unable to travel, he had started looking for jobs on Odesk, Rentacoder and such sites based on recommendation from his friend. After writing some software for a client, he noticed something important:</p>
<p><em>If he simply looked at the list of software projects available for jobs, he would have ideas on what software to develop.</em></p>
<p>He did this, and rather than making software for clients, he created his own software products, which he put on the internet. He said that 3 days after he copied a simple idea from the rentacoder list on his website, he was making 2 sales a day. $20 per day, which basically doubled his monthly earnings as a farmer. He continued working on more products and copying more ideas, and soon he had 10 different software that he was selling. Sales were low at the start, but even then for him it was a lot of money.</p>
<p>He kept doing this, cloning software he found that people wanted by looking at open projects on rentacoder, most of his software being related to video encoding. Additionally, he would take open source software, change the way it looked and sell it online. He said he’d get a few refunds, but most people would purchase it without complaining. He said he tried selling Firefox for a while, but sales were very low due to the free competition.</p>
<p>At the moment he’s making more than $5,000 a month, and he’s been making it for more than 4 years already. He’s one of the bigger players in the video encoding software market.</p>
<p>As I left, he dropped me off at the local hotel where my friends were. He shook my hand enthusiastically and said he would email me, but that he had to sleep now, because he had to go to the farm early the next morning. Surprised, I asked him why he still farmed. He shrugged and lifted his palms in that typical smiling manner that the villagers there have. “No why!” he said. “I enjoy farming”.</p>",,
2,Elijah Okokon,DMatrix,okoelijah@gmail.com,2,7,1,984,2,BUILD AROUND YOUR DISCOVERY MECHANISM,"<p>When you launch your web application, desktop software or any other type of software, the biggest problem you are going to face is very simple, but very hard to solve: People will not find your application.</p>
<p>For example, imagine Mr. Huang opens a shoe store and puts it in the corner of the town, in an area where there is no foot traffic. Very few people will find it, he goes broke, and he soon closes down. Mr. Rubenstein, on the other hand, puts the same shoe store on a busy shopping street. People are already there, all he needs to do them is add incentives for them to come in. The first guy has two problems (no people, no incentives) the second guy has one problem only, and he can easily test out different incentives to find the best one.</p>
<p>There may be a guy somewhere in Alaska who really really needs your software. You may really really need his money. But he will never find you. This is what will crush your product – the great big silence after launch.</p>
<p>Assuming you have not yet started working on your product, there is one thing that will make your life so very much easier: build around your discovery mechanism. Build on a busy shopping street, and not out in the corner of the town.</p>
<p>First of all, be very very clear on how you want users to discover your application. Then develop this part first. Then build everything else on top of that. If your application does not match your discovery mechanism, then change one of the two!</p>
<p>For example, if you are planning to gain users by search engine traffic, then make sure your product generates a lot of web pages, make sure the webpages interlink, study SEO FIRST, and THEN build your product.</p>
<p>If you plan to gain users by word of mouth, then focus on polishing the user experience. People will only recommend highly polished and non-frustrating software. Be sure to have some communication method with the initial crop of users.</p>
<p>If you plan to gain users by viral growth, then make sure virality is fundamental to your application, and not tacked on.</p>
<p>If you plan to gain users because you are in a closed eco-system like the Apple app store or Facebook, then find out the fundamental properties of these eco-systems, and make sure these are part of your app. For example, in the app store, you should cross-promote apps. In facebook, your apps should require more than one person to be useful.</p>
<p>Be very clear on how you want your apps to be discovered. Then build your application around this, otherwise your chance of just being ignored is high.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed that a lot of the time several asian restaurants will open right next to each other on the same street, instead of in some other “unserviced” part of town? They do that because in order to survive, they need to be discovered, otherwise they will be killed by the great silence.</p>",,
2,Elijah Okokon,DMatrix,okoelijah@gmail.com,2,7,1,985,2,DON'T ASK WHY YOU WERE REJECTED,"<p>I’ve noticed something that is not immediately obvious - rejections without explanations can be supremely helpful.</p>
<p>Imagine you are applying for a job, or for funding for a project of yours. You are confident going in – everything seems to be in place, and you are sure you will get accepted. But then you get rejected. The first question you will ask is : why? You want to know from the person exactly why you were unsuitable.</p>
<p>If the other party, however, does not give any reasons why you were rejected, this can be valuable to you. When people get rejected, they tend to reevaluate their initial concept under very critical eyes. What seemed perfect going in now seems riddled with flaws that could have been responsible for the rejection. The scales fall of their project and they can see it clearly. They fall out of love, and suddenly the lines on their lovers face are visible, and the once charming idiosyncrasies have become ugly flaws.</p>
<p>Being rejected without explanation allows people re-see their project and potentially abandon it or change it into something better. Being rejected with explanations gives them false hope – they focus then on only that small flaw that was pointed out to them and think fixing it would solve the problem.</p>
<p>But often, the explanation given is diplomatic and designed not to burn bridges, it’s not actual helpful advice that one can work on. So a rejection <em>with</em> reason can unnecessarily extend a project that should rightfully be dead. Or it could cause an over-focus on this one area, and all of the other flaws that were not listed in the reason (like personality flaws), go completely unworked on.</p>
<p>Getting rejected without reason is the best type of rejection, because it forces you to improve all aspects of your project. For a while, it allows you think and actually understand the problem. That’s because you’ll discover the problem by yourself.</p>",,
2,Elijah Okokon,DMatrix,okoelijah@gmail.com,2,7,1,986,2,THE SUNFLOWER,"<p>A field of sunflowers sat beside another field covered with grass. Perhaps long ago that grass field was a pasture for animals, but now there was nothing there except an old tractor in the corner.</p>
<p>An unusual gust of wind, going against the direction the wind usually went in that area, lifted a few sunflower seeds from a particularly full sunflower, and dropped them in the grassy field.</p>
<p>All but one died very quickly, the tangle of the grass preventing them from taking root. One particularly hardy (or perhaps lucky) sunflower seed, however, defied the odds and started to grow.</p>
<p>On a fine morning, that sunflower bloomed and showed its bright yellow face. As the light hit it, it became aware of where it was. It looked around at all the whispering grass, and knew already, it was different. The belief grew stronger and stronger, till one day, it broke through all the grass and it saw across to the sunflower field.</p>
<p>What joy it felt in its heart in that moment! It saw all the other sunflowers, yellow and glorious, so different from the grass that had surrounded it. Once in a while, the wind would bring the glorious singing of those sunflowers across, and this lone sunflower rejoiced at those voices, so different from the raspy whispering of the grass around it.</p>
<p>But it wondered - look how big and glorious those sunflowers are. And I am so small and misshapen. They sing so wonderfully, while my voice is cracked and muted.</p>
<p>The sunflower grew sadder and sadder by the day, and at some point, thought that that must be the reason he was sent to this grassy field - he did not fit in with the glory of all the other sunflowers. He watched little sunflowers grow big and bloom, while his petals stayed small and stunted.</p>
<p>Then he figured it out. The reason he was small and stunted was because he was in the grassy field. If he could go over to the other field, then he would be in the soil that was best for sunflowers and he would grow to be as magnificent as they were.</p>
<p>Being a plant, he was not sure how exactly he could go about moving to another field. So he asked a knot of grass close by - “Hey, do you know how I can go across to the other field?”</p>
<p>The grassy lump looked at him in silence for a while: “Sunflower, you’ve never spoken to us all this while you have been growing here. We are your neighbours, we’ve lived together all our lives. Why do you want to leave us and go live with the other sunflowers?</p>
<p>We’ve heard you complain for so long about how small your petals are, and how great the sunflowers over there are doing. You know why your petals are so small and stunted?</p>
<p>Because, Sunflower, you have turned your head to look to that field! You are a sunflower, look at the sun! All the looking into the other field is what has prevented you from being as magnificent as they are! Just turn to the sun and forget about the other field.”</p>
<p>The Sunflower, ashamed, saw that the grass was right. And he turned to the sun. In a few days, he bloomed and started growing. Soon, his petals were as big as the grandest from the other field - all the grass had made his soil very fertile.</p>
<p>A few years later, that grassy field was filled with grand sunflowers - children of that original sunflower - all looking proudly to the sun, growing and singing.</p>
<p>Till one day, again, another seed floated gently on an unusual gust of wind, into the next grassy field.</p>",,

7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,2,1,352,7,SHALLOW THINKING,"It's quite easy to be good enough at something that everyone around you praises you. For example, you can read a few books, do a couple of courses and everyone will see you as a 3D printing guru. But that's mostly because nobody else knows anything about 3D.

In a place without a large density of engineers, it's very easy to do this. It's easy to claim you are good at hardware hacking, or SEO or Google Adwords, and because almost nobody knows what these things are or is good at doing them, you are instantly seen as a guru.

People will start inviting you to give talks, your peers will refer to you as 'that genius', people will be hailing you.

You can't stop the above from happening, but the most destructive mistake anyone can make is to actually start believing it.

It's relatively easy to become better than the people around you at almost anything. It's actually trivially easy. But you will never, ever be good if those people are your yardstick for your own success.

A good way to know you are stuck in being slightly better than beginners is when you tend to teach beginners, novices or people who are just starting.

If you are truly good, you will be teaching intermediates or experts. Never beginners. The biggest coaches are always training experts, never starters.

To not fall into this trap, you have to avoid interacting with beginners till you have reached the advanced level. It sounds harsh, but if you don't do this, you will tend to compare yourself down instead of comparing yourself up. So you will see all you have achieved (which is very comforting), instead of all you have not achieved (which is much harder to look at).

Once you are at an advanced level, then you can start teaching others, and you are now teaching it much better.

I see this phenomena all too often - people looking for the praise and kudos of non-experts. They get it, and in the process condemn themselves to never become experts.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,2,1,353,7,TWO YEARS IN THE TRENCHES BUILDING HOTELS.NG,"Hotels.ng is about two years old now. In the first year, it was just a website — no business built around it. It started off by me purchasing lists of hotels. The entirety of hotels that were available in any known dataset that was available in public or in any government archive was about 1500 in Nigeria. I listed them all on the site and put the site up. Only 100 of those hotels had pictures. The pictures were scraped from the hotel websites.

In October 2012 I moved to Nigeria to try to build a business out of this hotel booking website. I landed, rented a flat in calabar and convinced a friend of mine, Charles, to join the project. I and Charles hit the streets of Calabar and started snapping photos of the hotels in Calabar. Soon we had the largest online list of hotels in Calabar. But none were yet bookable.

We coded a booking form one day and bought a company phone. We turned on the booking form and put the phone number on the site. We received 20 bookings for hotels in various parts of Nigeria that day, and had 100 missed calls on the phone. We could not book the hotels yet and we barely had time to address all the queries we received, so we took the number back off. We kept the booking form, but nothing would happen when people booked.

Some time later, Jason Njoku wrote me a message on Facebook that he was starting an investment company called Spark and that he wanted to invest in Hotels.ng. I went to Lagos, we had a 30 minute meeting on a hot balcony together with Bastian, then I returned to Calabar. The next day, they made an offer. A bit of negotiation and in January 2013 Hotels.ng received funds from Spark.

In the last 1 year, I used the investment money to build Hotels.ng into a company. We have 15 full-time staff, 5 contract staff and more than 70 ad-hoc staff. Those 70 people went everywhere in Nigeria and got hotels on our site. We now have 5080 hotels on the site. We have full pictures for 4000+ of all those hotels. We have addresses and driving instructions for all these hotels — we have massively accelerated the move of an African industry online.

The total value of the bookings that we have done for hotels in Nigeria on our website alone is currently 2.3 million USD. That value was generated without spending any money marketing the site. By its very existence, it is useful and people patronize it without us needing to tell them to use it.

By the end of the year 2013 we hit $40k in monthly revenue. I will follow up this post with other posts detailing how the process has been.

How has it been building a tech startup in Nigeria? Everyone always on the outside tries to show how their startup is doing awesome and taking over the market and all what not, but that’s not how it is on the inside.

The past two years have been like climbing a mountain — blindfolded. To do what we are doing, there is no roadmap. There is no book teaching how to create something that has never existed in this market before. So it was all experiments and trial-and-error. I never knew what would work and what would not, so we would need to spend to test out different things to find what seems to work good. And even when you find something that works, you need growth, so you need to find what works even better.

From composing the teams, deciding how to approach hotels, getting people across 36 states in Nigeria, figuring out how to book hotel rooms with hotels without internet, and even the small stuff like getting our own internet working, it has all been a journey of uncertainty.

### **GETTING STARTED WITH $50K**

Our initial raise was $75k, of which $25k went to buy a car (to close deals in Lagos). So we had $50k to deploy people across Nigeria and pay a team of 12 people. That’s N8 million. At the time, I though that it would be more than enough. But quickly I realised that things were far more expensive than you think they are. If you have N8mill for 6 months, you have about 1.3m per month. Salaries will take half that money. Developer will take a big chunk. Data purchase another big chunk. The money will finish very rapidly.

So we had to do another raise with Spark, this time $150k. In the first 6 months, the sheer amount of things that needed to be set up and built meant that it would have been very hard to build the neccessary relationships to raise any kind of investment from other parties.

My take-away from the initial raising money is this: If you are going to raise money for something complicated, make sure the money will last at least 1 year. You will need 6 months to build a lot of the processes and start generating revenue and another 6 months to build the relationships you need close your next round.

### **THE INITIAL BUILDING PROCESS**

When we first started, I had no idea how to build a team. I had never been in any kind of managerial position with more than 4 people. Initially, we had the system where everything was being controlled by me. After some wise advice from Victor Asemota, I split up into smaller units with team leaders. This was far more efficient and resulted in better performance.

Jason and Bastian were very helpful in this phase — they had far more experience than I in managing and hiring, and looking around at what was going on and discussing things with them helped clarify a lot of what the approach should be. Jason told me one of the other useful things I learnt, which is that a low performer in one field can become a high performer if you swap their job roles. So (forgive me for this, co-workers), a lot of the initial stages was me moving people around till I could find a good person/job-fit.

During this period, we had to figure out how to make things work. Now it seems so obvious in retrospect how to book hotels, but back then I genuinely did not know. I did not know how to fulfill a booking efficiently, how to approach the hotels to strike a commission deal and how to invoice the hotels in a way that would ensure that they paid us.

And most importantly, how do you do this across 4000+ hotels without getting confused with the amount of info you are dealing with? The first 6 months was just about building the processes, building the software systems we needed to manage this, figuring out how to field deploy people, etc.

The key take-aways from this period to me is: The things you do internally, they may seem super easy when you have figured them out, but they are not easy to discover. You cannot copy a company from the outside. Also, very importantly, a word is enough for the wise! When you have a problem, someone with far more experience can tell you just one word and it will make things suddenly fall into place. Talk to people who have more experience than you in the things you are doing!

After the first 6 months of furiously building Hotels.ng, things started running on their own. I was no longer an essential part of the process. So I took a 2 week holiday in Germany. That holiday was super-useful in discovering the parts of my process that were not working well and still needed me. I advice everyone to disconnect from the company for two weeks and observe how well it runs independent of you. If it requires you to be there, then it is not a scalable business.

So the day I came back, a tech founder friend of mine called me and said he had to tell me something important. I asked him what he was. He paused, then said: Rocket Internet are building a hotel booking website. It’s just like yours.

Rocket Internet. The guys with five hundred million dollars. Coming up against me. I had barely $70,000. I started sweating.

I had actually pitched those guys a while back to open a hotel booking website in Nigeria. I searched my email for the pitch-deck to see if it gave away anything. Reading that document made me realize how different assumptions about a business are from when you actually start the business. That would not help them.

How do we beat Rocket Internet? They had everything. Over the following week, I kept thinking about that. But then I noticed something — they kept studying us, trying to find out how we did it. They were trying to beat US.

That’s when I realised that somehow or the other, barely knowing it, we had become the largest hotel booking website in West Africa. So I didn’t have to beat Rocket Internet, they had to beat me.

If you think of it in battle terms, at this point we have two armies, both moving in darkness, trying to get as fast as possible to a particular location. The battle has not started. We were in the deployment phase, and we were far ahead.

So far, we had moved much faster than them. We had done smart things. Even when they started moving, we were accelerating faster than them by any metric you could count. And at a fraction of what they spent. Our total budget of our 20 man team was not up to the annual salary of their MD alone.

So on reflection, I understood how we could beat them. In this movement phase, I will always be faster because they have so far not demonstrated any ability to outsmart us. At some point in the future, both sides would have arrived and it’s time to start the actual battle (which involves having the site the customers prefer to use). A lot of that is based on your ability to market wisely and to build a product that delights customers so much that they market it for you. In both of those aspects, if this were something that more money means you must automatically win, then there would be no instagram or snapchat.

I don’t know what the future will bring, but I know that the team we have at Hotels.ng is good enough to win, even against a deep pocket competitor like Rocket. They have been around for 6 months now, and barely dented our number 1 position. The way we move will make it stay that way.

### **THE HASSLES**

When you are doing something that is changing the way an old and established market like the hotel industry in Nigeria is, with a lot of old rich men involved, you will face a lot of people who do not understand what you are trying to do.

We have faced a lot of hassles from different sectors — from the troubles our inventory guys face to the banks not understanding our business to the police trying to find out more about what we do, to our cars getting arrested.

This is Nigeria. This is Africa. This is normal. My advice: Have backup, have friends in high places, because if you truly disrupt, you will need their help to solve problems.

The reason so many foreign companies came to Africa and left again is that they could not deal with the problems. You have to know that there will be major problems, and you just solve them and keep going, without ever being distracted from the mission and vision.

### **FIRING PEOPLE**

It’s not easy to work with someone in close proximity for many months and then fire them. But the role of the CEO of a company is that of a care-taker of a company. You are there to do the best for the company. If a person genuinely cannot contribute to a company, a CEO is obliged to lay the person off.

I think it is better to just maintain a high standard when hiring and fire fast if you must fire. Because we are all humans and all kind — when you know someone well, you may be hesitant to do what’s best for the company because of pity.

### **THE TECH SCENE**

What we are building is not in isolation, it’s in the middle of the tech scene. This scene has been invaluable for the company and for me. I have never been a big fan of Lagos, but the fact of the matter is that this is where Nigerian tech is going to be. It will cluster in Lagos and likely in Yaba area.

Since coming to Lagos, I have met a large number of the “twitter famous” people. Each of those people have straight-up provided me with ideas or information. And those words really made a difference.

I strongly believe that technology is so complex and wide that without being in a community, it can never really take fruit and become something significant in the countries economy. One person discovers something, tells someone else. And the second person can use that info and connect it to solve a problem with his business.

The Nigerian tech community is small, but it is helpful. It needs to grow so that we can build a real technology industry here in the biggest African country. The success of technology in Nigeria will determine the success of technology across the rest of Africa, and in my opinion, I think any continent that is left behind in technology industry will forever fall behind in the global economy.

These small apps and websites we are creating now are important for this continent. They have the ability to change and transform it. They are what will create the future industries. So no matter what, we must never stop trying to build a local technology eco-system.

### **FINAL WORDS**

Building Hotels.ng has been hard. But it’s worth it to look at the site/business and see it working. See people booking hotels every day and it all somehow keeps running. All of this was done with the help of a larger technology eco-system, people who were willing to risk capital and the persistence and hard work of the team.

It’s been a good two years. Looking forward to the next two!",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,2,1,355,7,HOW TO AVOID BEING A ONE-HIT WONDER,"Most people, at some point, have a hit. Some hit blog post, some hit song, some hit startup, some great party and so on. But then that’s it. They try again, but it just doesn’t work the second time around. They try to do things exactly the same way, but it just does not work. Why is this? Why do some people have consistent hits and keep growing and getting better, while others just have one hit that they can never reproduce?

**THE FUNDAMENTALS**
--------------------

Think of some guy cooking dinner. He goes crazy, throwing various ingredients in the pot, roasting the meat on an open flame, flinging whatever he finds in the fridge into the pan, and randomly selects some red wine from the shop.

He invites his friends for dinner, and they are astounded. The meal is perfect – the meat is just right, the wine works perfectly, the soups are just perfectly flavored.

That guy just landed a hit. But it’s a hit he cannot reproduce. He does not know why that meal was so good, because he was just throwing things into the pot. He got lucky with a bit of intuition and some luck. Give him different ingredients, a different stove and he will make a terrible meal.

Contrast that with a professional cook. He can consistently give you a good meal, independent of what he has available to him. Sometimes, even the pro will make a dud, but most of the time, it will turn out right.

The core difference between them is simply that the professional cook has a good knowledge of the fundamentals. He has studied the theory behind what he is doing, or he has a huge wealth of experience. He knows how to sear meat, he knows the correct spices to mix with a particular dish. So what the other guy did by chance, he can consistently do.

Most one-hit wonders just don’t have the fundamentals. They work based on instinct and even though it may guide them to make a single hit, they will not understand how that hit came about. A person who has studied the fundamentals will see the hit like an insight that has opened new opportunities to him – he will recognize new things, but the other person will take nothing new from the experience.

**THE SOCIAL NETWORK**
----------------------

The world is filled with a bunch of extremely smart people. And these people don’t want anything to do with you. They don’t have the time to talk to any guy off the street. But when you have your hit, they will all want to talk to you. For a while.

The person who wants to make more than a single hit has to grasp this opportunity to force his way into the midst of this society. Because these very smart people are what will make your next hit.

You can’t keep repeating one thing that worked. It gets boring. You can’t sing the same song twice and expect it to be another hit. You can’t keep cooking the same dish. You can’t keep making the same website. You will need to make something new. And your new social network are what will make that second hit for you.

It’s like Lady Gaga trying to have a hit record. Hundreds of songwriters want her to sing their song. It’s easy for her to land another hit, because all the best producers will want to work with her. Her album has taken her into a new social network that she can now leverage to keep her fame high.

Some people, after landing their hit, don’t attempt to get to know the important people in the new social network. They remain at the same social level that they were at. That means they have to recreate a new hit all over again. That’s very difficult.

**THE HIT FACTORY**
-------------------

The person who makes hit after hit does so by a combination of two factors – he has the necessary knowledge about the fundamentals, and when he lands that hit that makes him visible, he leverages the new social network this opens to him. He uses the newly available brainpower to him to make the next hit.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,2,1,356,7,BUILD AROUND YOUR DISCOVERY MECHANISM,"When you launch your web application, desktop software or any other type of software, the biggest problem you are going to face is very simple, but very hard to solve: People will not find your application.

For example, imagine Mr. Huang opens a shoe store and puts it in the corner of the town, in an area where there is no foot traffic. Very few people will find it, he goes broke, and he soon closes down. Mr. Rubenstein, on the other hand, puts the same shoe store on a busy shopping street. People are already there, all he needs to do them is add incentives for them to come in. The first guy has two problems (no people, no incentives) the second guy has one problem only, and he can easily test out different incentives to find the best one.

There may be a guy somewhere in Alaska who really really needs your software. You may really really need his money. But he will never find you. This is what will crush your product – the great big silence after launch.

Assuming you have not yet started working on your product, there is one thing that will make your life so very much easier: build around your discovery mechanism. Build on a busy shopping street, and not out in the corner of the town.

First of all, be very very clear on how you want users to discover your application. Then develop this part first. Then build everything else on top of that. If your application does not match your discovery mechanism, then change one of the two!

For example, if you are planning to gain users by search engine traffic, then make sure your product generates a lot of web pages, make sure the webpages interlink, study SEO FIRST, and THEN build your product.

If you plan to gain users by word of mouth, then focus on polishing the user experience. People will only recommend highly polished and non-frustrating software. Be sure to have some communication method with the initial crop of users.

If you plan to gain users by viral growth, then make sure virality is fundamental to your application, and not tacked on.

If you plan to gain users because you are in a closed eco-system like the Apple app store or Facebook, then find out the fundamental properties of these eco-systems, and make sure these are part of your app. For example, in the app store, you should cross-promote apps. In facebook, your apps should require more than one person to be useful.

Be very clear on how you want your apps to be discovered. Then build your application around this, otherwise your chance of just being ignored is high.

Have you ever noticed that a lot of the time several asian restaurants will open right next to each other on the same street, instead of in some other “unserviced” part of town? They do that because in order to survive, they need to be discovered, otherwise they will be killed by the great silence.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,2,1,357,7,ARE YOU CAPABLE OF BEING RUTHLESS TO GET AHEAD?,"A few years ago, I was consulting in the technical department of a big company that makes electronics. One day at a company party, a young guy about 24 years old, roughly my age, walked up to me and introduced himself. He was a new recruit and was working in business development. He was funny, charming and intelligent. Over the next 6 months, I would watch him ruthlessly work his way into management, jumping over the heads of people who had been there for years.

I’ll call him Saul and talk a bit about his methods, because they were efficiently effective.

Being ruthless in business is like bringing a gun to a knife fight. People talk about cut-throat business, but actually business is pretty civilised and most people are quite nice to each other. So when a ruthless person comes along who is willing to just charge ahead and throw aside who ever stands in his way, for him it’s like taking candy from a baby. Or to put it in more realistic terms, taking a lot of money from a soft, slightly pudgy nerd.

What I’d like to do is list those external attributes that I observed in Saul – and if you can decide if you would be capable of doing the same to be successful.

1.  **Choose your friends**: Saul always had a lot friends, but he never stayed friends with people who had not moved up in the ranks with him. For example, when I first knew Saul, he was working as an entry-level employee in a large company. He was friends with everyone. He got friendly with the boss, and 6 months later, he was a manager. His old friends said that Saul would walk by them, chatting and laughing with the managers, and it would be like they never existed.

A core of Saul’s strategy, as he once explained was this – you can’t have a million close friends. You need to have close friends that are at your stage in life and higher, and for that, you have to leave the ones that stayed behind back.

When Saul needed something, he made sure that he gained as many friends in that particular area as he could. For example, when he made his play to get into management, he first became friends with his boss, and when his boss took him out, Saul got to know all the other managers, and became their friends.

When Saul wanted to get to know women, he identified the crowd of fun cool guys who were in contact with the women, and he became their friend. Saul would never pretend to be your friend just so you would fix his computer or something short-term like that – he created relationships with the people who would bring him forward.

1.  **Make sure your outwards appearance is perfect**: GTL – Gym, Tan, Laundry. Saul said that people will judge you immediately by your outward appearance, and the most profitable investment you can make is in good clothes, good shoes and a good body. He actually wears light make-up. It may seem vain, but this strategy gained him a lot of attention from women, and he would use women to climb up the ladder of success.

To expand his contacts, he would use his clique of women to gain the attention of the men he was interested in. And for the women to be interested in him, he micro-managed his body and dressing to the smallest details.

And let’s face it – have you seen many top management who look grubby? Being well groomed seems to be an essential attribute of leadership.

1.  **Invest in your location**: Saul spent an extra-ordinary percentage of his income on his home. He lived cheap and spent a large part of his income paying his rent in an expensive area, and furnishing his place really nicely.

One of the most important things he would do then would be to invite people to his home, and when people came in, they would be visibly impressed, and his worth would rise dramatically in their eyes.

Saul also had a network of a few locations he frequented where he knew the people and the staff. At any social gathering, Saul would work to navigate the group to these ‘safe’ territories, where he would then be in control of the situation.

1.  **Approach people and tell them what to do**: Saul had no fear of approaching people and telling them what to do. Rather than sitting in his desk and waiting for things to happen, Saul would always jump at every opportunity to approach someone and either build a relationship with them, or to do something for them.

For example, when new clients were brought on a tour of the company, he stood up and joined the entourage, chatting with the clients. The natural way he did this made it seem normal and accepted, and instantly got him noticed by the Vice President, who was leading the people around the office.

1.  **Keep your head when everyone else is getting caught up in the rush**: Whenever there was a panic or something that required swift action, Saul would always sit back and wait. He would not jump into the fray before he was sure what exactly was going on – which led to the impression that he rarely made mistakes.

On company outings, Saul would drink just a little, while encouraging everyone else to drink an excessive amount. This would result at some point in him taking over control of the group – and this was key to him assuming a de-facto leadership position a few weeks after entering the department.

What this brought him: Saul, shortly after arriving at the company became one of the most popular employees in his department. He was regularly going out for drinks with the head of department, and after a couple of months, she promoted him to something with an office, I’m not sure what.

Then she changed department, and because he had become the de-facto leader of the group, she recommended him for her job. He took over the job, and became close friends with most of the mid-level management. After a couple of months of hard-work, he threatened to transfer to another branch unless he would be promoted. He was promoted after a negotiation period.

Now, five years later I heard he’s running a department with more than a thousand people below him. When people talk about him, they don’t dislike him; they are just awed by the way he aggressively moved ahead. By building relationships, and by ending relationships when they were hampering him, he was able to achieve a lot of what he had told me as he arrived that he wanted to achieve.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,2,1,359,7,DO YOU NEED A CO-FOUNDER?,"Co-founders are both the most important thing that your company needs and the most likely reason your company will fail. If you don’t have any co-founders, when you hit that dip, that speed bump along the road, you will be unable to continue. There will be nobody to talk to, nobody to brainstorm with, nobody who will come up with fresh ideas or new ways of doing things. When the customers are complaining, when you hit an impossible bug, without a co-founder, it is easy to give up or just bury your head in unimportant work.

But with a co-founder, the situation can be even worse. It’s a bit like being married – if the marriage works out well, it’s way better than being single. But if the marriage turns out terrible, being single would be heavenly.

A while back when I was consulting in the DirectX area, I had a client called Eric. He was a soft spoken guy, incredibly nice, but he always had this air of sadness around him. Once, we were chatting in the evening, and he suddenly started telling me his life story. He had been running a software business with a co-founder from college, and the business had just started taking off. Suddenly, his co-founder started acting over-bearing and trying to get Eric to reduce his share of the business. They started fighting, they disagreed on some core features, and at some point, Eric came back home and he could not access the servers. An ugly battle started then that ended with Eric being ousted from the company in exchange for some cash.

The co-founders of small startups have very personal relationships. The line between family, friendship and work blurs completely and they intersect and merge with each other. Flaws in people become magnified when people get that close. Just like the biggest fights can be between brothers, people who have their lives so intertwined can get into big battles about unimportant things.

**HOW CO-FOUNDERS SHOULD BE**
-----------------------------

Imagine you were in some 16th century tavern, having an ale and then a man walks in and says – which of you men here is ready to join me in war, and have your chance at fame and fortune? You will immediately size up the man and decide – can I do battle with this man by my side? Can I follow this man? Can I trust this man? Will this man be smart enough to actually make me achieve fame and fortune, or will he leave me to bleed to death in some field?

A person who instills confidence in you in all of those questions is the person you want to co- found a company with.

And yes, a partnership is never really equal. There has to be someone who is somewhat more equal than others. There is nothing more devastating than a partnership were all the members have exactly equal rights and votes. This just does not work. Human society and all monkeys always have a single individual at the top and with all others, even though they are almost equal, being not quite equal.

Any company where several people believe they should have final say or be consulted on final say is usually going to fail with a bunch of arguments and fights. The partnership may actually work very well in this mode so long no money I’d bring made, but as soon as there is cash, the clashes will start.

There has to be a clear and obvious leader who has final say within every company. That’s just how the big apes roll.

**SO YOU WANT TO START A COMPANY, HUH?**
----------------------------------------

Don’t just go for the obvious co-founder person around you. You may have some guy you know who is somewhat good in IT, this should not be your cofounder just because he lives near you.

Spend some time getting out there and meeting people and finding out who you are compatible with. Form short term collaborations on small projects and websites and see with whom you can work the best. When you want to get serious with a co-founder, make sure you have really worked together for a while.

When you have someone you want to work with, you will know pretty quickly. It’s like meeting the right girl – you know quite quickly this is the person for you. But to find that person, you need to have met a lot of the wrong people first. Few people are lucky enough to meet the right person straight away, or to have the perfect person be your childhood friend.

**PROFESSIONALISM AS A WAY OF DOING THINGS**
--------------------------------------------

Crazy Internet startups where everyone is really chummy with each other are great way to start a company, but it does not scale. Close personal relationships means that people will get into fights, and in small companies, this can be devastating to morale and your productivity. As a company grows, relationships should be formalized. People who are friends should be friends, but people who are not the types likely to be friends should not be forced to do this.

Work should be governed by mutual respect between the people working. It will seem as if the tone of the company is becoming more drab, but taking away the biggest highs also takes away the lowest lows. And the company in the end is there to make money, and this works best when everyone feels comfortable at work, are able to be as quirky as they naturally are without getting in the hair of other people, and has their space to be productive in.

**THE STORY OF ERIC, COMPLETED**
--------------------------------

Eric, after having been kicked out of his company had hired me as a consultant to build his new software. I got a salary to do the code and also to talk with him about the software. He would come up with a business strategy and ask my opinion, and together we designed a good business model.

When the software was done, he said thank you and gave me a nice bonus. He launched the software and now, a few years later, he is one of the biggest players in the media world. I did a lot of follow up work and watched as he basically out-competed his old company to pieces. He took everything he knew from the old company and not only reimplemented it, he fixed the broken parts.

And when the big payout came, he did not have to share with anyone. Last I spoke to him, he has a lovely wife and is quite happy.

Business building is about relationships in no small way. When you start a company, keep that in mind, and choose wisely who you want to be that close to you.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,2,1,360,7,EVALUATING STARTUP IDEAS,"The only true currency we humans have is time. Everybody is given a pot of time when they are born, and every day they take out a little from it. One dreaded day, the pot is empty.

People will pay money to have a little more of that precious time. So many modern fortunes have been made with products that save people time, like the automobile or the telephone.

The best way to evaluate the value of a startup is by looking at the value of the time it saves. If it costs $100/hour to produce a screwdriver, and you are able to save 2 hours of that time with a product of yours, then every reasonable company would pay at least $100 to purchase that product.

That is the essence of many software business. Save a business or person some time, so they can go make more money. The value of the time you save is basically the value you can extract for that business.

![Evaluation Framework](https://markessien.com/content/images/2015/11/0-50Gvmue3SqekS13M.png)

The chart above demonstrates this. You can calculate the value your startup creates by filling in the numbers for the chart.

For example, lets look at the chart for the invention of the car. The car significantly increased the speed at which travel could be done. It also did this for something that was done very often (travel) and done by basically everyone. So the value generated by the car was huge.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,3,1,352,7,SHALLOW THINKING,"It's quite easy to be good enough at something that everyone around you praises you. For example, you can read a few books, do a couple of courses and everyone will see you as a 3D printing guru. But that's mostly because nobody else knows anything about 3D.

In a place without a large density of engineers, it's very easy to do this. It's easy to claim you are good at hardware hacking, or SEO or Google Adwords, and because almost nobody knows what these things are or is good at doing them, you are instantly seen as a guru.

People will start inviting you to give talks, your peers will refer to you as 'that genius', people will be hailing you.

You can't stop the above from happening, but the most destructive mistake anyone can make is to actually start believing it.

It's relatively easy to become better than the people around you at almost anything. It's actually trivially easy. But you will never, ever be good if those people are your yardstick for your own success.

A good way to know you are stuck in being slightly better than beginners is when you tend to teach beginners, novices or people who are just starting.

If you are truly good, you will be teaching intermediates or experts. Never beginners. The biggest coaches are always training experts, never starters.

To not fall into this trap, you have to avoid interacting with beginners till you have reached the advanced level. It sounds harsh, but if you don't do this, you will tend to compare yourself down instead of comparing yourself up. So you will see all you have achieved (which is very comforting), instead of all you have not achieved (which is much harder to look at).

Once you are at an advanced level, then you can start teaching others, and you are now teaching it much better.

I see this phenomena all too often - people looking for the praise and kudos of non-experts. They get it, and in the process condemn themselves to never become experts.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,3,1,353,7,TWO YEARS IN THE TRENCHES BUILDING HOTELS.NG,"Hotels.ng is about two years old now. In the first year, it was just a website — no business built around it. It started off by me purchasing lists of hotels. The entirety of hotels that were available in any known dataset that was available in public or in any government archive was about 1500 in Nigeria. I listed them all on the site and put the site up. Only 100 of those hotels had pictures. The pictures were scraped from the hotel websites.

In October 2012 I moved to Nigeria to try to build a business out of this hotel booking website. I landed, rented a flat in calabar and convinced a friend of mine, Charles, to join the project. I and Charles hit the streets of Calabar and started snapping photos of the hotels in Calabar. Soon we had the largest online list of hotels in Calabar. But none were yet bookable.

We coded a booking form one day and bought a company phone. We turned on the booking form and put the phone number on the site. We received 20 bookings for hotels in various parts of Nigeria that day, and had 100 missed calls on the phone. We could not book the hotels yet and we barely had time to address all the queries we received, so we took the number back off. We kept the booking form, but nothing would happen when people booked.

Some time later, Jason Njoku wrote me a message on Facebook that he was starting an investment company called Spark and that he wanted to invest in Hotels.ng. I went to Lagos, we had a 30 minute meeting on a hot balcony together with Bastian, then I returned to Calabar. The next day, they made an offer. A bit of negotiation and in January 2013 Hotels.ng received funds from Spark.

In the last 1 year, I used the investment money to build Hotels.ng into a company. We have 15 full-time staff, 5 contract staff and more than 70 ad-hoc staff. Those 70 people went everywhere in Nigeria and got hotels on our site. We now have 5080 hotels on the site. We have full pictures for 4000+ of all those hotels. We have addresses and driving instructions for all these hotels — we have massively accelerated the move of an African industry online.

The total value of the bookings that we have done for hotels in Nigeria on our website alone is currently 2.3 million USD. That value was generated without spending any money marketing the site. By its very existence, it is useful and people patronize it without us needing to tell them to use it.

By the end of the year 2013 we hit $40k in monthly revenue. I will follow up this post with other posts detailing how the process has been.

How has it been building a tech startup in Nigeria? Everyone always on the outside tries to show how their startup is doing awesome and taking over the market and all what not, but that’s not how it is on the inside.

The past two years have been like climbing a mountain — blindfolded. To do what we are doing, there is no roadmap. There is no book teaching how to create something that has never existed in this market before. So it was all experiments and trial-and-error. I never knew what would work and what would not, so we would need to spend to test out different things to find what seems to work good. And even when you find something that works, you need growth, so you need to find what works even better.

From composing the teams, deciding how to approach hotels, getting people across 36 states in Nigeria, figuring out how to book hotel rooms with hotels without internet, and even the small stuff like getting our own internet working, it has all been a journey of uncertainty.

### **GETTING STARTED WITH $50K**

Our initial raise was $75k, of which $25k went to buy a car (to close deals in Lagos). So we had $50k to deploy people across Nigeria and pay a team of 12 people. That’s N8 million. At the time, I though that it would be more than enough. But quickly I realised that things were far more expensive than you think they are. If you have N8mill for 6 months, you have about 1.3m per month. Salaries will take half that money. Developer will take a big chunk. Data purchase another big chunk. The money will finish very rapidly.

So we had to do another raise with Spark, this time $150k. In the first 6 months, the sheer amount of things that needed to be set up and built meant that it would have been very hard to build the neccessary relationships to raise any kind of investment from other parties.

My take-away from the initial raising money is this: If you are going to raise money for something complicated, make sure the money will last at least 1 year. You will need 6 months to build a lot of the processes and start generating revenue and another 6 months to build the relationships you need close your next round.

### **THE INITIAL BUILDING PROCESS**

When we first started, I had no idea how to build a team. I had never been in any kind of managerial position with more than 4 people. Initially, we had the system where everything was being controlled by me. After some wise advice from Victor Asemota, I split up into smaller units with team leaders. This was far more efficient and resulted in better performance.

Jason and Bastian were very helpful in this phase — they had far more experience than I in managing and hiring, and looking around at what was going on and discussing things with them helped clarify a lot of what the approach should be. Jason told me one of the other useful things I learnt, which is that a low performer in one field can become a high performer if you swap their job roles. So (forgive me for this, co-workers), a lot of the initial stages was me moving people around till I could find a good person/job-fit.

During this period, we had to figure out how to make things work. Now it seems so obvious in retrospect how to book hotels, but back then I genuinely did not know. I did not know how to fulfill a booking efficiently, how to approach the hotels to strike a commission deal and how to invoice the hotels in a way that would ensure that they paid us.

And most importantly, how do you do this across 4000+ hotels without getting confused with the amount of info you are dealing with? The first 6 months was just about building the processes, building the software systems we needed to manage this, figuring out how to field deploy people, etc.

The key take-aways from this period to me is: The things you do internally, they may seem super easy when you have figured them out, but they are not easy to discover. You cannot copy a company from the outside. Also, very importantly, a word is enough for the wise! When you have a problem, someone with far more experience can tell you just one word and it will make things suddenly fall into place. Talk to people who have more experience than you in the things you are doing!

After the first 6 months of furiously building Hotels.ng, things started running on their own. I was no longer an essential part of the process. So I took a 2 week holiday in Germany. That holiday was super-useful in discovering the parts of my process that were not working well and still needed me. I advice everyone to disconnect from the company for two weeks and observe how well it runs independent of you. If it requires you to be there, then it is not a scalable business.

So the day I came back, a tech founder friend of mine called me and said he had to tell me something important. I asked him what he was. He paused, then said: Rocket Internet are building a hotel booking website. It’s just like yours.

Rocket Internet. The guys with five hundred million dollars. Coming up against me. I had barely $70,000. I started sweating.

I had actually pitched those guys a while back to open a hotel booking website in Nigeria. I searched my email for the pitch-deck to see if it gave away anything. Reading that document made me realize how different assumptions about a business are from when you actually start the business. That would not help them.

How do we beat Rocket Internet? They had everything. Over the following week, I kept thinking about that. But then I noticed something — they kept studying us, trying to find out how we did it. They were trying to beat US.

That’s when I realised that somehow or the other, barely knowing it, we had become the largest hotel booking website in West Africa. So I didn’t have to beat Rocket Internet, they had to beat me.

If you think of it in battle terms, at this point we have two armies, both moving in darkness, trying to get as fast as possible to a particular location. The battle has not started. We were in the deployment phase, and we were far ahead.

So far, we had moved much faster than them. We had done smart things. Even when they started moving, we were accelerating faster than them by any metric you could count. And at a fraction of what they spent. Our total budget of our 20 man team was not up to the annual salary of their MD alone.

So on reflection, I understood how we could beat them. In this movement phase, I will always be faster because they have so far not demonstrated any ability to outsmart us. At some point in the future, both sides would have arrived and it’s time to start the actual battle (which involves having the site the customers prefer to use). A lot of that is based on your ability to market wisely and to build a product that delights customers so much that they market it for you. In both of those aspects, if this were something that more money means you must automatically win, then there would be no instagram or snapchat.

I don’t know what the future will bring, but I know that the team we have at Hotels.ng is good enough to win, even against a deep pocket competitor like Rocket. They have been around for 6 months now, and barely dented our number 1 position. The way we move will make it stay that way.

### **THE HASSLES**

When you are doing something that is changing the way an old and established market like the hotel industry in Nigeria is, with a lot of old rich men involved, you will face a lot of people who do not understand what you are trying to do.

We have faced a lot of hassles from different sectors — from the troubles our inventory guys face to the banks not understanding our business to the police trying to find out more about what we do, to our cars getting arrested.

This is Nigeria. This is Africa. This is normal. My advice: Have backup, have friends in high places, because if you truly disrupt, you will need their help to solve problems.

The reason so many foreign companies came to Africa and left again is that they could not deal with the problems. You have to know that there will be major problems, and you just solve them and keep going, without ever being distracted from the mission and vision.

### **FIRING PEOPLE**

It’s not easy to work with someone in close proximity for many months and then fire them. But the role of the CEO of a company is that of a care-taker of a company. You are there to do the best for the company. If a person genuinely cannot contribute to a company, a CEO is obliged to lay the person off.

I think it is better to just maintain a high standard when hiring and fire fast if you must fire. Because we are all humans and all kind — when you know someone well, you may be hesitant to do what’s best for the company because of pity.

### **THE TECH SCENE**

What we are building is not in isolation, it’s in the middle of the tech scene. This scene has been invaluable for the company and for me. I have never been a big fan of Lagos, but the fact of the matter is that this is where Nigerian tech is going to be. It will cluster in Lagos and likely in Yaba area.

Since coming to Lagos, I have met a large number of the “twitter famous” people. Each of those people have straight-up provided me with ideas or information. And those words really made a difference.

I strongly believe that technology is so complex and wide that without being in a community, it can never really take fruit and become something significant in the countries economy. One person discovers something, tells someone else. And the second person can use that info and connect it to solve a problem with his business.

The Nigerian tech community is small, but it is helpful. It needs to grow so that we can build a real technology industry here in the biggest African country. The success of technology in Nigeria will determine the success of technology across the rest of Africa, and in my opinion, I think any continent that is left behind in technology industry will forever fall behind in the global economy.

These small apps and websites we are creating now are important for this continent. They have the ability to change and transform it. They are what will create the future industries. So no matter what, we must never stop trying to build a local technology eco-system.

### **FINAL WORDS**

Building Hotels.ng has been hard. But it’s worth it to look at the site/business and see it working. See people booking hotels every day and it all somehow keeps running. All of this was done with the help of a larger technology eco-system, people who were willing to risk capital and the persistence and hard work of the team.

It’s been a good two years. Looking forward to the next two!",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,3,1,355,7,HOW TO AVOID BEING A ONE-HIT WONDER,"Most people, at some point, have a hit. Some hit blog post, some hit song, some hit startup, some great party and so on. But then that’s it. They try again, but it just doesn’t work the second time around. They try to do things exactly the same way, but it just does not work. Why is this? Why do some people have consistent hits and keep growing and getting better, while others just have one hit that they can never reproduce?

**THE FUNDAMENTALS**
--------------------

Think of some guy cooking dinner. He goes crazy, throwing various ingredients in the pot, roasting the meat on an open flame, flinging whatever he finds in the fridge into the pan, and randomly selects some red wine from the shop.

He invites his friends for dinner, and they are astounded. The meal is perfect – the meat is just right, the wine works perfectly, the soups are just perfectly flavored.

That guy just landed a hit. But it’s a hit he cannot reproduce. He does not know why that meal was so good, because he was just throwing things into the pot. He got lucky with a bit of intuition and some luck. Give him different ingredients, a different stove and he will make a terrible meal.

Contrast that with a professional cook. He can consistently give you a good meal, independent of what he has available to him. Sometimes, even the pro will make a dud, but most of the time, it will turn out right.

The core difference between them is simply that the professional cook has a good knowledge of the fundamentals. He has studied the theory behind what he is doing, or he has a huge wealth of experience. He knows how to sear meat, he knows the correct spices to mix with a particular dish. So what the other guy did by chance, he can consistently do.

Most one-hit wonders just don’t have the fundamentals. They work based on instinct and even though it may guide them to make a single hit, they will not understand how that hit came about. A person who has studied the fundamentals will see the hit like an insight that has opened new opportunities to him – he will recognize new things, but the other person will take nothing new from the experience.

**THE SOCIAL NETWORK**
----------------------

The world is filled with a bunch of extremely smart people. And these people don’t want anything to do with you. They don’t have the time to talk to any guy off the street. But when you have your hit, they will all want to talk to you. For a while.

The person who wants to make more than a single hit has to grasp this opportunity to force his way into the midst of this society. Because these very smart people are what will make your next hit.

You can’t keep repeating one thing that worked. It gets boring. You can’t sing the same song twice and expect it to be another hit. You can’t keep cooking the same dish. You can’t keep making the same website. You will need to make something new. And your new social network are what will make that second hit for you.

It’s like Lady Gaga trying to have a hit record. Hundreds of songwriters want her to sing their song. It’s easy for her to land another hit, because all the best producers will want to work with her. Her album has taken her into a new social network that she can now leverage to keep her fame high.

Some people, after landing their hit, don’t attempt to get to know the important people in the new social network. They remain at the same social level that they were at. That means they have to recreate a new hit all over again. That’s very difficult.

**THE HIT FACTORY**
-------------------

The person who makes hit after hit does so by a combination of two factors – he has the necessary knowledge about the fundamentals, and when he lands that hit that makes him visible, he leverages the new social network this opens to him. He uses the newly available brainpower to him to make the next hit.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,3,1,356,7,BUILD AROUND YOUR DISCOVERY MECHANISM,"When you launch your web application, desktop software or any other type of software, the biggest problem you are going to face is very simple, but very hard to solve: People will not find your application.

For example, imagine Mr. Huang opens a shoe store and puts it in the corner of the town, in an area where there is no foot traffic. Very few people will find it, he goes broke, and he soon closes down. Mr. Rubenstein, on the other hand, puts the same shoe store on a busy shopping street. People are already there, all he needs to do them is add incentives for them to come in. The first guy has two problems (no people, no incentives) the second guy has one problem only, and he can easily test out different incentives to find the best one.

There may be a guy somewhere in Alaska who really really needs your software. You may really really need his money. But he will never find you. This is what will crush your product – the great big silence after launch.

Assuming you have not yet started working on your product, there is one thing that will make your life so very much easier: build around your discovery mechanism. Build on a busy shopping street, and not out in the corner of the town.

First of all, be very very clear on how you want users to discover your application. Then develop this part first. Then build everything else on top of that. If your application does not match your discovery mechanism, then change one of the two!

For example, if you are planning to gain users by search engine traffic, then make sure your product generates a lot of web pages, make sure the webpages interlink, study SEO FIRST, and THEN build your product.

If you plan to gain users by word of mouth, then focus on polishing the user experience. People will only recommend highly polished and non-frustrating software. Be sure to have some communication method with the initial crop of users.

If you plan to gain users by viral growth, then make sure virality is fundamental to your application, and not tacked on.

If you plan to gain users because you are in a closed eco-system like the Apple app store or Facebook, then find out the fundamental properties of these eco-systems, and make sure these are part of your app. For example, in the app store, you should cross-promote apps. In facebook, your apps should require more than one person to be useful.

Be very clear on how you want your apps to be discovered. Then build your application around this, otherwise your chance of just being ignored is high.

Have you ever noticed that a lot of the time several asian restaurants will open right next to each other on the same street, instead of in some other “unserviced” part of town? They do that because in order to survive, they need to be discovered, otherwise they will be killed by the great silence.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,3,1,357,7,ARE YOU CAPABLE OF BEING RUTHLESS TO GET AHEAD?,"A few years ago, I was consulting in the technical department of a big company that makes electronics. One day at a company party, a young guy about 24 years old, roughly my age, walked up to me and introduced himself. He was a new recruit and was working in business development. He was funny, charming and intelligent. Over the next 6 months, I would watch him ruthlessly work his way into management, jumping over the heads of people who had been there for years.

I’ll call him Saul and talk a bit about his methods, because they were efficiently effective.

Being ruthless in business is like bringing a gun to a knife fight. People talk about cut-throat business, but actually business is pretty civilised and most people are quite nice to each other. So when a ruthless person comes along who is willing to just charge ahead and throw aside who ever stands in his way, for him it’s like taking candy from a baby. Or to put it in more realistic terms, taking a lot of money from a soft, slightly pudgy nerd.

What I’d like to do is list those external attributes that I observed in Saul – and if you can decide if you would be capable of doing the same to be successful.

1.  **Choose your friends**: Saul always had a lot friends, but he never stayed friends with people who had not moved up in the ranks with him. For example, when I first knew Saul, he was working as an entry-level employee in a large company. He was friends with everyone. He got friendly with the boss, and 6 months later, he was a manager. His old friends said that Saul would walk by them, chatting and laughing with the managers, and it would be like they never existed.

A core of Saul’s strategy, as he once explained was this – you can’t have a million close friends. You need to have close friends that are at your stage in life and higher, and for that, you have to leave the ones that stayed behind back.

When Saul needed something, he made sure that he gained as many friends in that particular area as he could. For example, when he made his play to get into management, he first became friends with his boss, and when his boss took him out, Saul got to know all the other managers, and became their friends.

When Saul wanted to get to know women, he identified the crowd of fun cool guys who were in contact with the women, and he became their friend. Saul would never pretend to be your friend just so you would fix his computer or something short-term like that – he created relationships with the people who would bring him forward.

1.  **Make sure your outwards appearance is perfect**: GTL – Gym, Tan, Laundry. Saul said that people will judge you immediately by your outward appearance, and the most profitable investment you can make is in good clothes, good shoes and a good body. He actually wears light make-up. It may seem vain, but this strategy gained him a lot of attention from women, and he would use women to climb up the ladder of success.

To expand his contacts, he would use his clique of women to gain the attention of the men he was interested in. And for the women to be interested in him, he micro-managed his body and dressing to the smallest details.

And let’s face it – have you seen many top management who look grubby? Being well groomed seems to be an essential attribute of leadership.

1.  **Invest in your location**: Saul spent an extra-ordinary percentage of his income on his home. He lived cheap and spent a large part of his income paying his rent in an expensive area, and furnishing his place really nicely.

One of the most important things he would do then would be to invite people to his home, and when people came in, they would be visibly impressed, and his worth would rise dramatically in their eyes.

Saul also had a network of a few locations he frequented where he knew the people and the staff. At any social gathering, Saul would work to navigate the group to these ‘safe’ territories, where he would then be in control of the situation.

1.  **Approach people and tell them what to do**: Saul had no fear of approaching people and telling them what to do. Rather than sitting in his desk and waiting for things to happen, Saul would always jump at every opportunity to approach someone and either build a relationship with them, or to do something for them.

For example, when new clients were brought on a tour of the company, he stood up and joined the entourage, chatting with the clients. The natural way he did this made it seem normal and accepted, and instantly got him noticed by the Vice President, who was leading the people around the office.

1.  **Keep your head when everyone else is getting caught up in the rush**: Whenever there was a panic or something that required swift action, Saul would always sit back and wait. He would not jump into the fray before he was sure what exactly was going on – which led to the impression that he rarely made mistakes.

On company outings, Saul would drink just a little, while encouraging everyone else to drink an excessive amount. This would result at some point in him taking over control of the group – and this was key to him assuming a de-facto leadership position a few weeks after entering the department.

What this brought him: Saul, shortly after arriving at the company became one of the most popular employees in his department. He was regularly going out for drinks with the head of department, and after a couple of months, she promoted him to something with an office, I’m not sure what.

Then she changed department, and because he had become the de-facto leader of the group, she recommended him for her job. He took over the job, and became close friends with most of the mid-level management. After a couple of months of hard-work, he threatened to transfer to another branch unless he would be promoted. He was promoted after a negotiation period.

Now, five years later I heard he’s running a department with more than a thousand people below him. When people talk about him, they don’t dislike him; they are just awed by the way he aggressively moved ahead. By building relationships, and by ending relationships when they were hampering him, he was able to achieve a lot of what he had told me as he arrived that he wanted to achieve.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,3,1,359,7,DO YOU NEED A CO-FOUNDER?,"Co-founders are both the most important thing that your company needs and the most likely reason your company will fail. If you don’t have any co-founders, when you hit that dip, that speed bump along the road, you will be unable to continue. There will be nobody to talk to, nobody to brainstorm with, nobody who will come up with fresh ideas or new ways of doing things. When the customers are complaining, when you hit an impossible bug, without a co-founder, it is easy to give up or just bury your head in unimportant work.

But with a co-founder, the situation can be even worse. It’s a bit like being married – if the marriage works out well, it’s way better than being single. But if the marriage turns out terrible, being single would be heavenly.

A while back when I was consulting in the DirectX area, I had a client called Eric. He was a soft spoken guy, incredibly nice, but he always had this air of sadness around him. Once, we were chatting in the evening, and he suddenly started telling me his life story. He had been running a software business with a co-founder from college, and the business had just started taking off. Suddenly, his co-founder started acting over-bearing and trying to get Eric to reduce his share of the business. They started fighting, they disagreed on some core features, and at some point, Eric came back home and he could not access the servers. An ugly battle started then that ended with Eric being ousted from the company in exchange for some cash.

The co-founders of small startups have very personal relationships. The line between family, friendship and work blurs completely and they intersect and merge with each other. Flaws in people become magnified when people get that close. Just like the biggest fights can be between brothers, people who have their lives so intertwined can get into big battles about unimportant things.

**HOW CO-FOUNDERS SHOULD BE**
-----------------------------

Imagine you were in some 16th century tavern, having an ale and then a man walks in and says – which of you men here is ready to join me in war, and have your chance at fame and fortune? You will immediately size up the man and decide – can I do battle with this man by my side? Can I follow this man? Can I trust this man? Will this man be smart enough to actually make me achieve fame and fortune, or will he leave me to bleed to death in some field?

A person who instills confidence in you in all of those questions is the person you want to co- found a company with.

And yes, a partnership is never really equal. There has to be someone who is somewhat more equal than others. There is nothing more devastating than a partnership were all the members have exactly equal rights and votes. This just does not work. Human society and all monkeys always have a single individual at the top and with all others, even though they are almost equal, being not quite equal.

Any company where several people believe they should have final say or be consulted on final say is usually going to fail with a bunch of arguments and fights. The partnership may actually work very well in this mode so long no money I’d bring made, but as soon as there is cash, the clashes will start.

There has to be a clear and obvious leader who has final say within every company. That’s just how the big apes roll.

**SO YOU WANT TO START A COMPANY, HUH?**
----------------------------------------

Don’t just go for the obvious co-founder person around you. You may have some guy you know who is somewhat good in IT, this should not be your cofounder just because he lives near you.

Spend some time getting out there and meeting people and finding out who you are compatible with. Form short term collaborations on small projects and websites and see with whom you can work the best. When you want to get serious with a co-founder, make sure you have really worked together for a while.

When you have someone you want to work with, you will know pretty quickly. It’s like meeting the right girl – you know quite quickly this is the person for you. But to find that person, you need to have met a lot of the wrong people first. Few people are lucky enough to meet the right person straight away, or to have the perfect person be your childhood friend.

**PROFESSIONALISM AS A WAY OF DOING THINGS**
--------------------------------------------

Crazy Internet startups where everyone is really chummy with each other are great way to start a company, but it does not scale. Close personal relationships means that people will get into fights, and in small companies, this can be devastating to morale and your productivity. As a company grows, relationships should be formalized. People who are friends should be friends, but people who are not the types likely to be friends should not be forced to do this.

Work should be governed by mutual respect between the people working. It will seem as if the tone of the company is becoming more drab, but taking away the biggest highs also takes away the lowest lows. And the company in the end is there to make money, and this works best when everyone feels comfortable at work, are able to be as quirky as they naturally are without getting in the hair of other people, and has their space to be productive in.

**THE STORY OF ERIC, COMPLETED**
--------------------------------

Eric, after having been kicked out of his company had hired me as a consultant to build his new software. I got a salary to do the code and also to talk with him about the software. He would come up with a business strategy and ask my opinion, and together we designed a good business model.

When the software was done, he said thank you and gave me a nice bonus. He launched the software and now, a few years later, he is one of the biggest players in the media world. I did a lot of follow up work and watched as he basically out-competed his old company to pieces. He took everything he knew from the old company and not only reimplemented it, he fixed the broken parts.

And when the big payout came, he did not have to share with anyone. Last I spoke to him, he has a lovely wife and is quite happy.

Business building is about relationships in no small way. When you start a company, keep that in mind, and choose wisely who you want to be that close to you.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,3,1,360,7,EVALUATING STARTUP IDEAS,"The only true currency we humans have is time. Everybody is given a pot of time when they are born, and every day they take out a little from it. One dreaded day, the pot is empty.

People will pay money to have a little more of that precious time. So many modern fortunes have been made with products that save people time, like the automobile or the telephone.

The best way to evaluate the value of a startup is by looking at the value of the time it saves. If it costs $100/hour to produce a screwdriver, and you are able to save 2 hours of that time with a product of yours, then every reasonable company would pay at least $100 to purchase that product.

That is the essence of many software business. Save a business or person some time, so they can go make more money. The value of the time you save is basically the value you can extract for that business.

![Evaluation Framework](https://markessien.com/content/images/2015/11/0-50Gvmue3SqekS13M.png)

The chart above demonstrates this. You can calculate the value your startup creates by filling in the numbers for the chart.

For example, lets look at the chart for the invention of the car. The car significantly increased the speed at which travel could be done. It also did this for something that was done very often (travel) and done by basically everyone. So the value generated by the car was huge.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,11,1,352,7,SHALLOW THINKING,"It's quite easy to be good enough at something that everyone around you praises you. For example, you can read a few books, do a couple of courses and everyone will see you as a 3D printing guru. But that's mostly because nobody else knows anything about 3D.

In a place without a large density of engineers, it's very easy to do this. It's easy to claim you are good at hardware hacking, or SEO or Google Adwords, and because almost nobody knows what these things are or is good at doing them, you are instantly seen as a guru.

People will start inviting you to give talks, your peers will refer to you as 'that genius', people will be hailing you.

You can't stop the above from happening, but the most destructive mistake anyone can make is to actually start believing it.

It's relatively easy to become better than the people around you at almost anything. It's actually trivially easy. But you will never, ever be good if those people are your yardstick for your own success.

A good way to know you are stuck in being slightly better than beginners is when you tend to teach beginners, novices or people who are just starting.

If you are truly good, you will be teaching intermediates or experts. Never beginners. The biggest coaches are always training experts, never starters.

To not fall into this trap, you have to avoid interacting with beginners till you have reached the advanced level. It sounds harsh, but if you don't do this, you will tend to compare yourself down instead of comparing yourself up. So you will see all you have achieved (which is very comforting), instead of all you have not achieved (which is much harder to look at).

Once you are at an advanced level, then you can start teaching others, and you are now teaching it much better.

I see this phenomena all too often - people looking for the praise and kudos of non-experts. They get it, and in the process condemn themselves to never become experts.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,11,1,353,7,TWO YEARS IN THE TRENCHES BUILDING HOTELS.NG,"Hotels.ng is about two years old now. In the first year, it was just a website — no business built around it. It started off by me purchasing lists of hotels. The entirety of hotels that were available in any known dataset that was available in public or in any government archive was about 1500 in Nigeria. I listed them all on the site and put the site up. Only 100 of those hotels had pictures. The pictures were scraped from the hotel websites.

In October 2012 I moved to Nigeria to try to build a business out of this hotel booking website. I landed, rented a flat in calabar and convinced a friend of mine, Charles, to join the project. I and Charles hit the streets of Calabar and started snapping photos of the hotels in Calabar. Soon we had the largest online list of hotels in Calabar. But none were yet bookable.

We coded a booking form one day and bought a company phone. We turned on the booking form and put the phone number on the site. We received 20 bookings for hotels in various parts of Nigeria that day, and had 100 missed calls on the phone. We could not book the hotels yet and we barely had time to address all the queries we received, so we took the number back off. We kept the booking form, but nothing would happen when people booked.

Some time later, Jason Njoku wrote me a message on Facebook that he was starting an investment company called Spark and that he wanted to invest in Hotels.ng. I went to Lagos, we had a 30 minute meeting on a hot balcony together with Bastian, then I returned to Calabar. The next day, they made an offer. A bit of negotiation and in January 2013 Hotels.ng received funds from Spark.

In the last 1 year, I used the investment money to build Hotels.ng into a company. We have 15 full-time staff, 5 contract staff and more than 70 ad-hoc staff. Those 70 people went everywhere in Nigeria and got hotels on our site. We now have 5080 hotels on the site. We have full pictures for 4000+ of all those hotels. We have addresses and driving instructions for all these hotels — we have massively accelerated the move of an African industry online.

The total value of the bookings that we have done for hotels in Nigeria on our website alone is currently 2.3 million USD. That value was generated without spending any money marketing the site. By its very existence, it is useful and people patronize it without us needing to tell them to use it.

By the end of the year 2013 we hit $40k in monthly revenue. I will follow up this post with other posts detailing how the process has been.

How has it been building a tech startup in Nigeria? Everyone always on the outside tries to show how their startup is doing awesome and taking over the market and all what not, but that’s not how it is on the inside.

The past two years have been like climbing a mountain — blindfolded. To do what we are doing, there is no roadmap. There is no book teaching how to create something that has never existed in this market before. So it was all experiments and trial-and-error. I never knew what would work and what would not, so we would need to spend to test out different things to find what seems to work good. And even when you find something that works, you need growth, so you need to find what works even better.

From composing the teams, deciding how to approach hotels, getting people across 36 states in Nigeria, figuring out how to book hotel rooms with hotels without internet, and even the small stuff like getting our own internet working, it has all been a journey of uncertainty.

### **GETTING STARTED WITH $50K**

Our initial raise was $75k, of which $25k went to buy a car (to close deals in Lagos). So we had $50k to deploy people across Nigeria and pay a team of 12 people. That’s N8 million. At the time, I though that it would be more than enough. But quickly I realised that things were far more expensive than you think they are. If you have N8mill for 6 months, you have about 1.3m per month. Salaries will take half that money. Developer will take a big chunk. Data purchase another big chunk. The money will finish very rapidly.

So we had to do another raise with Spark, this time $150k. In the first 6 months, the sheer amount of things that needed to be set up and built meant that it would have been very hard to build the neccessary relationships to raise any kind of investment from other parties.

My take-away from the initial raising money is this: If you are going to raise money for something complicated, make sure the money will last at least 1 year. You will need 6 months to build a lot of the processes and start generating revenue and another 6 months to build the relationships you need close your next round.

### **THE INITIAL BUILDING PROCESS**

When we first started, I had no idea how to build a team. I had never been in any kind of managerial position with more than 4 people. Initially, we had the system where everything was being controlled by me. After some wise advice from Victor Asemota, I split up into smaller units with team leaders. This was far more efficient and resulted in better performance.

Jason and Bastian were very helpful in this phase — they had far more experience than I in managing and hiring, and looking around at what was going on and discussing things with them helped clarify a lot of what the approach should be. Jason told me one of the other useful things I learnt, which is that a low performer in one field can become a high performer if you swap their job roles. So (forgive me for this, co-workers), a lot of the initial stages was me moving people around till I could find a good person/job-fit.

During this period, we had to figure out how to make things work. Now it seems so obvious in retrospect how to book hotels, but back then I genuinely did not know. I did not know how to fulfill a booking efficiently, how to approach the hotels to strike a commission deal and how to invoice the hotels in a way that would ensure that they paid us.

And most importantly, how do you do this across 4000+ hotels without getting confused with the amount of info you are dealing with? The first 6 months was just about building the processes, building the software systems we needed to manage this, figuring out how to field deploy people, etc.

The key take-aways from this period to me is: The things you do internally, they may seem super easy when you have figured them out, but they are not easy to discover. You cannot copy a company from the outside. Also, very importantly, a word is enough for the wise! When you have a problem, someone with far more experience can tell you just one word and it will make things suddenly fall into place. Talk to people who have more experience than you in the things you are doing!

After the first 6 months of furiously building Hotels.ng, things started running on their own. I was no longer an essential part of the process. So I took a 2 week holiday in Germany. That holiday was super-useful in discovering the parts of my process that were not working well and still needed me. I advice everyone to disconnect from the company for two weeks and observe how well it runs independent of you. If it requires you to be there, then it is not a scalable business.

So the day I came back, a tech founder friend of mine called me and said he had to tell me something important. I asked him what he was. He paused, then said: Rocket Internet are building a hotel booking website. It’s just like yours.

Rocket Internet. The guys with five hundred million dollars. Coming up against me. I had barely $70,000. I started sweating.

I had actually pitched those guys a while back to open a hotel booking website in Nigeria. I searched my email for the pitch-deck to see if it gave away anything. Reading that document made me realize how different assumptions about a business are from when you actually start the business. That would not help them.

How do we beat Rocket Internet? They had everything. Over the following week, I kept thinking about that. But then I noticed something — they kept studying us, trying to find out how we did it. They were trying to beat US.

That’s when I realised that somehow or the other, barely knowing it, we had become the largest hotel booking website in West Africa. So I didn’t have to beat Rocket Internet, they had to beat me.

If you think of it in battle terms, at this point we have two armies, both moving in darkness, trying to get as fast as possible to a particular location. The battle has not started. We were in the deployment phase, and we were far ahead.

So far, we had moved much faster than them. We had done smart things. Even when they started moving, we were accelerating faster than them by any metric you could count. And at a fraction of what they spent. Our total budget of our 20 man team was not up to the annual salary of their MD alone.

So on reflection, I understood how we could beat them. In this movement phase, I will always be faster because they have so far not demonstrated any ability to outsmart us. At some point in the future, both sides would have arrived and it’s time to start the actual battle (which involves having the site the customers prefer to use). A lot of that is based on your ability to market wisely and to build a product that delights customers so much that they market it for you. In both of those aspects, if this were something that more money means you must automatically win, then there would be no instagram or snapchat.

I don’t know what the future will bring, but I know that the team we have at Hotels.ng is good enough to win, even against a deep pocket competitor like Rocket. They have been around for 6 months now, and barely dented our number 1 position. The way we move will make it stay that way.

### **THE HASSLES**

When you are doing something that is changing the way an old and established market like the hotel industry in Nigeria is, with a lot of old rich men involved, you will face a lot of people who do not understand what you are trying to do.

We have faced a lot of hassles from different sectors — from the troubles our inventory guys face to the banks not understanding our business to the police trying to find out more about what we do, to our cars getting arrested.

This is Nigeria. This is Africa. This is normal. My advice: Have backup, have friends in high places, because if you truly disrupt, you will need their help to solve problems.

The reason so many foreign companies came to Africa and left again is that they could not deal with the problems. You have to know that there will be major problems, and you just solve them and keep going, without ever being distracted from the mission and vision.

### **FIRING PEOPLE**

It’s not easy to work with someone in close proximity for many months and then fire them. But the role of the CEO of a company is that of a care-taker of a company. You are there to do the best for the company. If a person genuinely cannot contribute to a company, a CEO is obliged to lay the person off.

I think it is better to just maintain a high standard when hiring and fire fast if you must fire. Because we are all humans and all kind — when you know someone well, you may be hesitant to do what’s best for the company because of pity.

### **THE TECH SCENE**

What we are building is not in isolation, it’s in the middle of the tech scene. This scene has been invaluable for the company and for me. I have never been a big fan of Lagos, but the fact of the matter is that this is where Nigerian tech is going to be. It will cluster in Lagos and likely in Yaba area.

Since coming to Lagos, I have met a large number of the “twitter famous” people. Each of those people have straight-up provided me with ideas or information. And those words really made a difference.

I strongly believe that technology is so complex and wide that without being in a community, it can never really take fruit and become something significant in the countries economy. One person discovers something, tells someone else. And the second person can use that info and connect it to solve a problem with his business.

The Nigerian tech community is small, but it is helpful. It needs to grow so that we can build a real technology industry here in the biggest African country. The success of technology in Nigeria will determine the success of technology across the rest of Africa, and in my opinion, I think any continent that is left behind in technology industry will forever fall behind in the global economy.

These small apps and websites we are creating now are important for this continent. They have the ability to change and transform it. They are what will create the future industries. So no matter what, we must never stop trying to build a local technology eco-system.

### **FINAL WORDS**

Building Hotels.ng has been hard. But it’s worth it to look at the site/business and see it working. See people booking hotels every day and it all somehow keeps running. All of this was done with the help of a larger technology eco-system, people who were willing to risk capital and the persistence and hard work of the team.

It’s been a good two years. Looking forward to the next two!",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,11,1,355,7,HOW TO AVOID BEING A ONE-HIT WONDER,"Most people, at some point, have a hit. Some hit blog post, some hit song, some hit startup, some great party and so on. But then that’s it. They try again, but it just doesn’t work the second time around. They try to do things exactly the same way, but it just does not work. Why is this? Why do some people have consistent hits and keep growing and getting better, while others just have one hit that they can never reproduce?

**THE FUNDAMENTALS**
--------------------

Think of some guy cooking dinner. He goes crazy, throwing various ingredients in the pot, roasting the meat on an open flame, flinging whatever he finds in the fridge into the pan, and randomly selects some red wine from the shop.

He invites his friends for dinner, and they are astounded. The meal is perfect – the meat is just right, the wine works perfectly, the soups are just perfectly flavored.

That guy just landed a hit. But it’s a hit he cannot reproduce. He does not know why that meal was so good, because he was just throwing things into the pot. He got lucky with a bit of intuition and some luck. Give him different ingredients, a different stove and he will make a terrible meal.

Contrast that with a professional cook. He can consistently give you a good meal, independent of what he has available to him. Sometimes, even the pro will make a dud, but most of the time, it will turn out right.

The core difference between them is simply that the professional cook has a good knowledge of the fundamentals. He has studied the theory behind what he is doing, or he has a huge wealth of experience. He knows how to sear meat, he knows the correct spices to mix with a particular dish. So what the other guy did by chance, he can consistently do.

Most one-hit wonders just don’t have the fundamentals. They work based on instinct and even though it may guide them to make a single hit, they will not understand how that hit came about. A person who has studied the fundamentals will see the hit like an insight that has opened new opportunities to him – he will recognize new things, but the other person will take nothing new from the experience.

**THE SOCIAL NETWORK**
----------------------

The world is filled with a bunch of extremely smart people. And these people don’t want anything to do with you. They don’t have the time to talk to any guy off the street. But when you have your hit, they will all want to talk to you. For a while.

The person who wants to make more than a single hit has to grasp this opportunity to force his way into the midst of this society. Because these very smart people are what will make your next hit.

You can’t keep repeating one thing that worked. It gets boring. You can’t sing the same song twice and expect it to be another hit. You can’t keep cooking the same dish. You can’t keep making the same website. You will need to make something new. And your new social network are what will make that second hit for you.

It’s like Lady Gaga trying to have a hit record. Hundreds of songwriters want her to sing their song. It’s easy for her to land another hit, because all the best producers will want to work with her. Her album has taken her into a new social network that she can now leverage to keep her fame high.

Some people, after landing their hit, don’t attempt to get to know the important people in the new social network. They remain at the same social level that they were at. That means they have to recreate a new hit all over again. That’s very difficult.

**THE HIT FACTORY**
-------------------

The person who makes hit after hit does so by a combination of two factors – he has the necessary knowledge about the fundamentals, and when he lands that hit that makes him visible, he leverages the new social network this opens to him. He uses the newly available brainpower to him to make the next hit.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,11,1,356,7,BUILD AROUND YOUR DISCOVERY MECHANISM,"When you launch your web application, desktop software or any other type of software, the biggest problem you are going to face is very simple, but very hard to solve: People will not find your application.

For example, imagine Mr. Huang opens a shoe store and puts it in the corner of the town, in an area where there is no foot traffic. Very few people will find it, he goes broke, and he soon closes down. Mr. Rubenstein, on the other hand, puts the same shoe store on a busy shopping street. People are already there, all he needs to do them is add incentives for them to come in. The first guy has two problems (no people, no incentives) the second guy has one problem only, and he can easily test out different incentives to find the best one.

There may be a guy somewhere in Alaska who really really needs your software. You may really really need his money. But he will never find you. This is what will crush your product – the great big silence after launch.

Assuming you have not yet started working on your product, there is one thing that will make your life so very much easier: build around your discovery mechanism. Build on a busy shopping street, and not out in the corner of the town.

First of all, be very very clear on how you want users to discover your application. Then develop this part first. Then build everything else on top of that. If your application does not match your discovery mechanism, then change one of the two!

For example, if you are planning to gain users by search engine traffic, then make sure your product generates a lot of web pages, make sure the webpages interlink, study SEO FIRST, and THEN build your product.

If you plan to gain users by word of mouth, then focus on polishing the user experience. People will only recommend highly polished and non-frustrating software. Be sure to have some communication method with the initial crop of users.

If you plan to gain users by viral growth, then make sure virality is fundamental to your application, and not tacked on.

If you plan to gain users because you are in a closed eco-system like the Apple app store or Facebook, then find out the fundamental properties of these eco-systems, and make sure these are part of your app. For example, in the app store, you should cross-promote apps. In facebook, your apps should require more than one person to be useful.

Be very clear on how you want your apps to be discovered. Then build your application around this, otherwise your chance of just being ignored is high.

Have you ever noticed that a lot of the time several asian restaurants will open right next to each other on the same street, instead of in some other “unserviced” part of town? They do that because in order to survive, they need to be discovered, otherwise they will be killed by the great silence.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,11,1,357,7,ARE YOU CAPABLE OF BEING RUTHLESS TO GET AHEAD?,"A few years ago, I was consulting in the technical department of a big company that makes electronics. One day at a company party, a young guy about 24 years old, roughly my age, walked up to me and introduced himself. He was a new recruit and was working in business development. He was funny, charming and intelligent. Over the next 6 months, I would watch him ruthlessly work his way into management, jumping over the heads of people who had been there for years.

I’ll call him Saul and talk a bit about his methods, because they were efficiently effective.

Being ruthless in business is like bringing a gun to a knife fight. People talk about cut-throat business, but actually business is pretty civilised and most people are quite nice to each other. So when a ruthless person comes along who is willing to just charge ahead and throw aside who ever stands in his way, for him it’s like taking candy from a baby. Or to put it in more realistic terms, taking a lot of money from a soft, slightly pudgy nerd.

What I’d like to do is list those external attributes that I observed in Saul – and if you can decide if you would be capable of doing the same to be successful.

1.  **Choose your friends**: Saul always had a lot friends, but he never stayed friends with people who had not moved up in the ranks with him. For example, when I first knew Saul, he was working as an entry-level employee in a large company. He was friends with everyone. He got friendly with the boss, and 6 months later, he was a manager. His old friends said that Saul would walk by them, chatting and laughing with the managers, and it would be like they never existed.

A core of Saul’s strategy, as he once explained was this – you can’t have a million close friends. You need to have close friends that are at your stage in life and higher, and for that, you have to leave the ones that stayed behind back.

When Saul needed something, he made sure that he gained as many friends in that particular area as he could. For example, when he made his play to get into management, he first became friends with his boss, and when his boss took him out, Saul got to know all the other managers, and became their friends.

When Saul wanted to get to know women, he identified the crowd of fun cool guys who were in contact with the women, and he became their friend. Saul would never pretend to be your friend just so you would fix his computer or something short-term like that – he created relationships with the people who would bring him forward.

1.  **Make sure your outwards appearance is perfect**: GTL – Gym, Tan, Laundry. Saul said that people will judge you immediately by your outward appearance, and the most profitable investment you can make is in good clothes, good shoes and a good body. He actually wears light make-up. It may seem vain, but this strategy gained him a lot of attention from women, and he would use women to climb up the ladder of success.

To expand his contacts, he would use his clique of women to gain the attention of the men he was interested in. And for the women to be interested in him, he micro-managed his body and dressing to the smallest details.

And let’s face it – have you seen many top management who look grubby? Being well groomed seems to be an essential attribute of leadership.

1.  **Invest in your location**: Saul spent an extra-ordinary percentage of his income on his home. He lived cheap and spent a large part of his income paying his rent in an expensive area, and furnishing his place really nicely.

One of the most important things he would do then would be to invite people to his home, and when people came in, they would be visibly impressed, and his worth would rise dramatically in their eyes.

Saul also had a network of a few locations he frequented where he knew the people and the staff. At any social gathering, Saul would work to navigate the group to these ‘safe’ territories, where he would then be in control of the situation.

1.  **Approach people and tell them what to do**: Saul had no fear of approaching people and telling them what to do. Rather than sitting in his desk and waiting for things to happen, Saul would always jump at every opportunity to approach someone and either build a relationship with them, or to do something for them.

For example, when new clients were brought on a tour of the company, he stood up and joined the entourage, chatting with the clients. The natural way he did this made it seem normal and accepted, and instantly got him noticed by the Vice President, who was leading the people around the office.

1.  **Keep your head when everyone else is getting caught up in the rush**: Whenever there was a panic or something that required swift action, Saul would always sit back and wait. He would not jump into the fray before he was sure what exactly was going on – which led to the impression that he rarely made mistakes.

On company outings, Saul would drink just a little, while encouraging everyone else to drink an excessive amount. This would result at some point in him taking over control of the group – and this was key to him assuming a de-facto leadership position a few weeks after entering the department.

What this brought him: Saul, shortly after arriving at the company became one of the most popular employees in his department. He was regularly going out for drinks with the head of department, and after a couple of months, she promoted him to something with an office, I’m not sure what.

Then she changed department, and because he had become the de-facto leader of the group, she recommended him for her job. He took over the job, and became close friends with most of the mid-level management. After a couple of months of hard-work, he threatened to transfer to another branch unless he would be promoted. He was promoted after a negotiation period.

Now, five years later I heard he’s running a department with more than a thousand people below him. When people talk about him, they don’t dislike him; they are just awed by the way he aggressively moved ahead. By building relationships, and by ending relationships when they were hampering him, he was able to achieve a lot of what he had told me as he arrived that he wanted to achieve.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,11,1,359,7,DO YOU NEED A CO-FOUNDER?,"Co-founders are both the most important thing that your company needs and the most likely reason your company will fail. If you don’t have any co-founders, when you hit that dip, that speed bump along the road, you will be unable to continue. There will be nobody to talk to, nobody to brainstorm with, nobody who will come up with fresh ideas or new ways of doing things. When the customers are complaining, when you hit an impossible bug, without a co-founder, it is easy to give up or just bury your head in unimportant work.

But with a co-founder, the situation can be even worse. It’s a bit like being married – if the marriage works out well, it’s way better than being single. But if the marriage turns out terrible, being single would be heavenly.

A while back when I was consulting in the DirectX area, I had a client called Eric. He was a soft spoken guy, incredibly nice, but he always had this air of sadness around him. Once, we were chatting in the evening, and he suddenly started telling me his life story. He had been running a software business with a co-founder from college, and the business had just started taking off. Suddenly, his co-founder started acting over-bearing and trying to get Eric to reduce his share of the business. They started fighting, they disagreed on some core features, and at some point, Eric came back home and he could not access the servers. An ugly battle started then that ended with Eric being ousted from the company in exchange for some cash.

The co-founders of small startups have very personal relationships. The line between family, friendship and work blurs completely and they intersect and merge with each other. Flaws in people become magnified when people get that close. Just like the biggest fights can be between brothers, people who have their lives so intertwined can get into big battles about unimportant things.

**HOW CO-FOUNDERS SHOULD BE**
-----------------------------

Imagine you were in some 16th century tavern, having an ale and then a man walks in and says – which of you men here is ready to join me in war, and have your chance at fame and fortune? You will immediately size up the man and decide – can I do battle with this man by my side? Can I follow this man? Can I trust this man? Will this man be smart enough to actually make me achieve fame and fortune, or will he leave me to bleed to death in some field?

A person who instills confidence in you in all of those questions is the person you want to co- found a company with.

And yes, a partnership is never really equal. There has to be someone who is somewhat more equal than others. There is nothing more devastating than a partnership were all the members have exactly equal rights and votes. This just does not work. Human society and all monkeys always have a single individual at the top and with all others, even though they are almost equal, being not quite equal.

Any company where several people believe they should have final say or be consulted on final say is usually going to fail with a bunch of arguments and fights. The partnership may actually work very well in this mode so long no money I’d bring made, but as soon as there is cash, the clashes will start.

There has to be a clear and obvious leader who has final say within every company. That’s just how the big apes roll.

**SO YOU WANT TO START A COMPANY, HUH?**
----------------------------------------

Don’t just go for the obvious co-founder person around you. You may have some guy you know who is somewhat good in IT, this should not be your cofounder just because he lives near you.

Spend some time getting out there and meeting people and finding out who you are compatible with. Form short term collaborations on small projects and websites and see with whom you can work the best. When you want to get serious with a co-founder, make sure you have really worked together for a while.

When you have someone you want to work with, you will know pretty quickly. It’s like meeting the right girl – you know quite quickly this is the person for you. But to find that person, you need to have met a lot of the wrong people first. Few people are lucky enough to meet the right person straight away, or to have the perfect person be your childhood friend.

**PROFESSIONALISM AS A WAY OF DOING THINGS**
--------------------------------------------

Crazy Internet startups where everyone is really chummy with each other are great way to start a company, but it does not scale. Close personal relationships means that people will get into fights, and in small companies, this can be devastating to morale and your productivity. As a company grows, relationships should be formalized. People who are friends should be friends, but people who are not the types likely to be friends should not be forced to do this.

Work should be governed by mutual respect between the people working. It will seem as if the tone of the company is becoming more drab, but taking away the biggest highs also takes away the lowest lows. And the company in the end is there to make money, and this works best when everyone feels comfortable at work, are able to be as quirky as they naturally are without getting in the hair of other people, and has their space to be productive in.

**THE STORY OF ERIC, COMPLETED**
--------------------------------

Eric, after having been kicked out of his company had hired me as a consultant to build his new software. I got a salary to do the code and also to talk with him about the software. He would come up with a business strategy and ask my opinion, and together we designed a good business model.

When the software was done, he said thank you and gave me a nice bonus. He launched the software and now, a few years later, he is one of the biggest players in the media world. I did a lot of follow up work and watched as he basically out-competed his old company to pieces. He took everything he knew from the old company and not only reimplemented it, he fixed the broken parts.

And when the big payout came, he did not have to share with anyone. Last I spoke to him, he has a lovely wife and is quite happy.

Business building is about relationships in no small way. When you start a company, keep that in mind, and choose wisely who you want to be that close to you.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,11,1,360,7,EVALUATING STARTUP IDEAS,"The only true currency we humans have is time. Everybody is given a pot of time when they are born, and every day they take out a little from it. One dreaded day, the pot is empty.

People will pay money to have a little more of that precious time. So many modern fortunes have been made with products that save people time, like the automobile or the telephone.

The best way to evaluate the value of a startup is by looking at the value of the time it saves. If it costs $100/hour to produce a screwdriver, and you are able to save 2 hours of that time with a product of yours, then every reasonable company would pay at least $100 to purchase that product.

That is the essence of many software business. Save a business or person some time, so they can go make more money. The value of the time you save is basically the value you can extract for that business.

![Evaluation Framework](https://markessien.com/content/images/2015/11/0-50Gvmue3SqekS13M.png)

The chart above demonstrates this. You can calculate the value your startup creates by filling in the numbers for the chart.

For example, lets look at the chart for the invention of the car. The car significantly increased the speed at which travel could be done. It also did this for something that was done very often (travel) and done by basically everyone. So the value generated by the car was huge.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,6,1,352,7,SHALLOW THINKING,"It's quite easy to be good enough at something that everyone around you praises you. For example, you can read a few books, do a couple of courses and everyone will see you as a 3D printing guru. But that's mostly because nobody else knows anything about 3D.

In a place without a large density of engineers, it's very easy to do this. It's easy to claim you are good at hardware hacking, or SEO or Google Adwords, and because almost nobody knows what these things are or is good at doing them, you are instantly seen as a guru.

People will start inviting you to give talks, your peers will refer to you as 'that genius', people will be hailing you.

You can't stop the above from happening, but the most destructive mistake anyone can make is to actually start believing it.

It's relatively easy to become better than the people around you at almost anything. It's actually trivially easy. But you will never, ever be good if those people are your yardstick for your own success.

A good way to know you are stuck in being slightly better than beginners is when you tend to teach beginners, novices or people who are just starting.

If you are truly good, you will be teaching intermediates or experts. Never beginners. The biggest coaches are always training experts, never starters.

To not fall into this trap, you have to avoid interacting with beginners till you have reached the advanced level. It sounds harsh, but if you don't do this, you will tend to compare yourself down instead of comparing yourself up. So you will see all you have achieved (which is very comforting), instead of all you have not achieved (which is much harder to look at).

Once you are at an advanced level, then you can start teaching others, and you are now teaching it much better.

I see this phenomena all too often - people looking for the praise and kudos of non-experts. They get it, and in the process condemn themselves to never become experts.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,6,1,353,7,TWO YEARS IN THE TRENCHES BUILDING HOTELS.NG,"Hotels.ng is about two years old now. In the first year, it was just a website — no business built around it. It started off by me purchasing lists of hotels. The entirety of hotels that were available in any known dataset that was available in public or in any government archive was about 1500 in Nigeria. I listed them all on the site and put the site up. Only 100 of those hotels had pictures. The pictures were scraped from the hotel websites.

In October 2012 I moved to Nigeria to try to build a business out of this hotel booking website. I landed, rented a flat in calabar and convinced a friend of mine, Charles, to join the project. I and Charles hit the streets of Calabar and started snapping photos of the hotels in Calabar. Soon we had the largest online list of hotels in Calabar. But none were yet bookable.

We coded a booking form one day and bought a company phone. We turned on the booking form and put the phone number on the site. We received 20 bookings for hotels in various parts of Nigeria that day, and had 100 missed calls on the phone. We could not book the hotels yet and we barely had time to address all the queries we received, so we took the number back off. We kept the booking form, but nothing would happen when people booked.

Some time later, Jason Njoku wrote me a message on Facebook that he was starting an investment company called Spark and that he wanted to invest in Hotels.ng. I went to Lagos, we had a 30 minute meeting on a hot balcony together with Bastian, then I returned to Calabar. The next day, they made an offer. A bit of negotiation and in January 2013 Hotels.ng received funds from Spark.

In the last 1 year, I used the investment money to build Hotels.ng into a company. We have 15 full-time staff, 5 contract staff and more than 70 ad-hoc staff. Those 70 people went everywhere in Nigeria and got hotels on our site. We now have 5080 hotels on the site. We have full pictures for 4000+ of all those hotels. We have addresses and driving instructions for all these hotels — we have massively accelerated the move of an African industry online.

The total value of the bookings that we have done for hotels in Nigeria on our website alone is currently 2.3 million USD. That value was generated without spending any money marketing the site. By its very existence, it is useful and people patronize it without us needing to tell them to use it.

By the end of the year 2013 we hit $40k in monthly revenue. I will follow up this post with other posts detailing how the process has been.

How has it been building a tech startup in Nigeria? Everyone always on the outside tries to show how their startup is doing awesome and taking over the market and all what not, but that’s not how it is on the inside.

The past two years have been like climbing a mountain — blindfolded. To do what we are doing, there is no roadmap. There is no book teaching how to create something that has never existed in this market before. So it was all experiments and trial-and-error. I never knew what would work and what would not, so we would need to spend to test out different things to find what seems to work good. And even when you find something that works, you need growth, so you need to find what works even better.

From composing the teams, deciding how to approach hotels, getting people across 36 states in Nigeria, figuring out how to book hotel rooms with hotels without internet, and even the small stuff like getting our own internet working, it has all been a journey of uncertainty.

### **GETTING STARTED WITH $50K**

Our initial raise was $75k, of which $25k went to buy a car (to close deals in Lagos). So we had $50k to deploy people across Nigeria and pay a team of 12 people. That’s N8 million. At the time, I though that it would be more than enough. But quickly I realised that things were far more expensive than you think they are. If you have N8mill for 6 months, you have about 1.3m per month. Salaries will take half that money. Developer will take a big chunk. Data purchase another big chunk. The money will finish very rapidly.

So we had to do another raise with Spark, this time $150k. In the first 6 months, the sheer amount of things that needed to be set up and built meant that it would have been very hard to build the neccessary relationships to raise any kind of investment from other parties.

My take-away from the initial raising money is this: If you are going to raise money for something complicated, make sure the money will last at least 1 year. You will need 6 months to build a lot of the processes and start generating revenue and another 6 months to build the relationships you need close your next round.

### **THE INITIAL BUILDING PROCESS**

When we first started, I had no idea how to build a team. I had never been in any kind of managerial position with more than 4 people. Initially, we had the system where everything was being controlled by me. After some wise advice from Victor Asemota, I split up into smaller units with team leaders. This was far more efficient and resulted in better performance.

Jason and Bastian were very helpful in this phase — they had far more experience than I in managing and hiring, and looking around at what was going on and discussing things with them helped clarify a lot of what the approach should be. Jason told me one of the other useful things I learnt, which is that a low performer in one field can become a high performer if you swap their job roles. So (forgive me for this, co-workers), a lot of the initial stages was me moving people around till I could find a good person/job-fit.

During this period, we had to figure out how to make things work. Now it seems so obvious in retrospect how to book hotels, but back then I genuinely did not know. I did not know how to fulfill a booking efficiently, how to approach the hotels to strike a commission deal and how to invoice the hotels in a way that would ensure that they paid us.

And most importantly, how do you do this across 4000+ hotels without getting confused with the amount of info you are dealing with? The first 6 months was just about building the processes, building the software systems we needed to manage this, figuring out how to field deploy people, etc.

The key take-aways from this period to me is: The things you do internally, they may seem super easy when you have figured them out, but they are not easy to discover. You cannot copy a company from the outside. Also, very importantly, a word is enough for the wise! When you have a problem, someone with far more experience can tell you just one word and it will make things suddenly fall into place. Talk to people who have more experience than you in the things you are doing!

After the first 6 months of furiously building Hotels.ng, things started running on their own. I was no longer an essential part of the process. So I took a 2 week holiday in Germany. That holiday was super-useful in discovering the parts of my process that were not working well and still needed me. I advice everyone to disconnect from the company for two weeks and observe how well it runs independent of you. If it requires you to be there, then it is not a scalable business.

So the day I came back, a tech founder friend of mine called me and said he had to tell me something important. I asked him what he was. He paused, then said: Rocket Internet are building a hotel booking website. It’s just like yours.

Rocket Internet. The guys with five hundred million dollars. Coming up against me. I had barely $70,000. I started sweating.

I had actually pitched those guys a while back to open a hotel booking website in Nigeria. I searched my email for the pitch-deck to see if it gave away anything. Reading that document made me realize how different assumptions about a business are from when you actually start the business. That would not help them.

How do we beat Rocket Internet? They had everything. Over the following week, I kept thinking about that. But then I noticed something — they kept studying us, trying to find out how we did it. They were trying to beat US.

That’s when I realised that somehow or the other, barely knowing it, we had become the largest hotel booking website in West Africa. So I didn’t have to beat Rocket Internet, they had to beat me.

If you think of it in battle terms, at this point we have two armies, both moving in darkness, trying to get as fast as possible to a particular location. The battle has not started. We were in the deployment phase, and we were far ahead.

So far, we had moved much faster than them. We had done smart things. Even when they started moving, we were accelerating faster than them by any metric you could count. And at a fraction of what they spent. Our total budget of our 20 man team was not up to the annual salary of their MD alone.

So on reflection, I understood how we could beat them. In this movement phase, I will always be faster because they have so far not demonstrated any ability to outsmart us. At some point in the future, both sides would have arrived and it’s time to start the actual battle (which involves having the site the customers prefer to use). A lot of that is based on your ability to market wisely and to build a product that delights customers so much that they market it for you. In both of those aspects, if this were something that more money means you must automatically win, then there would be no instagram or snapchat.

I don’t know what the future will bring, but I know that the team we have at Hotels.ng is good enough to win, even against a deep pocket competitor like Rocket. They have been around for 6 months now, and barely dented our number 1 position. The way we move will make it stay that way.

### **THE HASSLES**

When you are doing something that is changing the way an old and established market like the hotel industry in Nigeria is, with a lot of old rich men involved, you will face a lot of people who do not understand what you are trying to do.

We have faced a lot of hassles from different sectors — from the troubles our inventory guys face to the banks not understanding our business to the police trying to find out more about what we do, to our cars getting arrested.

This is Nigeria. This is Africa. This is normal. My advice: Have backup, have friends in high places, because if you truly disrupt, you will need their help to solve problems.

The reason so many foreign companies came to Africa and left again is that they could not deal with the problems. You have to know that there will be major problems, and you just solve them and keep going, without ever being distracted from the mission and vision.

### **FIRING PEOPLE**

It’s not easy to work with someone in close proximity for many months and then fire them. But the role of the CEO of a company is that of a care-taker of a company. You are there to do the best for the company. If a person genuinely cannot contribute to a company, a CEO is obliged to lay the person off.

I think it is better to just maintain a high standard when hiring and fire fast if you must fire. Because we are all humans and all kind — when you know someone well, you may be hesitant to do what’s best for the company because of pity.

### **THE TECH SCENE**

What we are building is not in isolation, it’s in the middle of the tech scene. This scene has been invaluable for the company and for me. I have never been a big fan of Lagos, but the fact of the matter is that this is where Nigerian tech is going to be. It will cluster in Lagos and likely in Yaba area.

Since coming to Lagos, I have met a large number of the “twitter famous” people. Each of those people have straight-up provided me with ideas or information. And those words really made a difference.

I strongly believe that technology is so complex and wide that without being in a community, it can never really take fruit and become something significant in the countries economy. One person discovers something, tells someone else. And the second person can use that info and connect it to solve a problem with his business.

The Nigerian tech community is small, but it is helpful. It needs to grow so that we can build a real technology industry here in the biggest African country. The success of technology in Nigeria will determine the success of technology across the rest of Africa, and in my opinion, I think any continent that is left behind in technology industry will forever fall behind in the global economy.

These small apps and websites we are creating now are important for this continent. They have the ability to change and transform it. They are what will create the future industries. So no matter what, we must never stop trying to build a local technology eco-system.

### **FINAL WORDS**

Building Hotels.ng has been hard. But it’s worth it to look at the site/business and see it working. See people booking hotels every day and it all somehow keeps running. All of this was done with the help of a larger technology eco-system, people who were willing to risk capital and the persistence and hard work of the team.

It’s been a good two years. Looking forward to the next two!",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,6,1,355,7,HOW TO AVOID BEING A ONE-HIT WONDER,"Most people, at some point, have a hit. Some hit blog post, some hit song, some hit startup, some great party and so on. But then that’s it. They try again, but it just doesn’t work the second time around. They try to do things exactly the same way, but it just does not work. Why is this? Why do some people have consistent hits and keep growing and getting better, while others just have one hit that they can never reproduce?

**THE FUNDAMENTALS**
--------------------

Think of some guy cooking dinner. He goes crazy, throwing various ingredients in the pot, roasting the meat on an open flame, flinging whatever he finds in the fridge into the pan, and randomly selects some red wine from the shop.

He invites his friends for dinner, and they are astounded. The meal is perfect – the meat is just right, the wine works perfectly, the soups are just perfectly flavored.

That guy just landed a hit. But it’s a hit he cannot reproduce. He does not know why that meal was so good, because he was just throwing things into the pot. He got lucky with a bit of intuition and some luck. Give him different ingredients, a different stove and he will make a terrible meal.

Contrast that with a professional cook. He can consistently give you a good meal, independent of what he has available to him. Sometimes, even the pro will make a dud, but most of the time, it will turn out right.

The core difference between them is simply that the professional cook has a good knowledge of the fundamentals. He has studied the theory behind what he is doing, or he has a huge wealth of experience. He knows how to sear meat, he knows the correct spices to mix with a particular dish. So what the other guy did by chance, he can consistently do.

Most one-hit wonders just don’t have the fundamentals. They work based on instinct and even though it may guide them to make a single hit, they will not understand how that hit came about. A person who has studied the fundamentals will see the hit like an insight that has opened new opportunities to him – he will recognize new things, but the other person will take nothing new from the experience.

**THE SOCIAL NETWORK**
----------------------

The world is filled with a bunch of extremely smart people. And these people don’t want anything to do with you. They don’t have the time to talk to any guy off the street. But when you have your hit, they will all want to talk to you. For a while.

The person who wants to make more than a single hit has to grasp this opportunity to force his way into the midst of this society. Because these very smart people are what will make your next hit.

You can’t keep repeating one thing that worked. It gets boring. You can’t sing the same song twice and expect it to be another hit. You can’t keep cooking the same dish. You can’t keep making the same website. You will need to make something new. And your new social network are what will make that second hit for you.

It’s like Lady Gaga trying to have a hit record. Hundreds of songwriters want her to sing their song. It’s easy for her to land another hit, because all the best producers will want to work with her. Her album has taken her into a new social network that she can now leverage to keep her fame high.

Some people, after landing their hit, don’t attempt to get to know the important people in the new social network. They remain at the same social level that they were at. That means they have to recreate a new hit all over again. That’s very difficult.

**THE HIT FACTORY**
-------------------

The person who makes hit after hit does so by a combination of two factors – he has the necessary knowledge about the fundamentals, and when he lands that hit that makes him visible, he leverages the new social network this opens to him. He uses the newly available brainpower to him to make the next hit.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,6,1,356,7,BUILD AROUND YOUR DISCOVERY MECHANISM,"When you launch your web application, desktop software or any other type of software, the biggest problem you are going to face is very simple, but very hard to solve: People will not find your application.

For example, imagine Mr. Huang opens a shoe store and puts it in the corner of the town, in an area where there is no foot traffic. Very few people will find it, he goes broke, and he soon closes down. Mr. Rubenstein, on the other hand, puts the same shoe store on a busy shopping street. People are already there, all he needs to do them is add incentives for them to come in. The first guy has two problems (no people, no incentives) the second guy has one problem only, and he can easily test out different incentives to find the best one.

There may be a guy somewhere in Alaska who really really needs your software. You may really really need his money. But he will never find you. This is what will crush your product – the great big silence after launch.

Assuming you have not yet started working on your product, there is one thing that will make your life so very much easier: build around your discovery mechanism. Build on a busy shopping street, and not out in the corner of the town.

First of all, be very very clear on how you want users to discover your application. Then develop this part first. Then build everything else on top of that. If your application does not match your discovery mechanism, then change one of the two!

For example, if you are planning to gain users by search engine traffic, then make sure your product generates a lot of web pages, make sure the webpages interlink, study SEO FIRST, and THEN build your product.

If you plan to gain users by word of mouth, then focus on polishing the user experience. People will only recommend highly polished and non-frustrating software. Be sure to have some communication method with the initial crop of users.

If you plan to gain users by viral growth, then make sure virality is fundamental to your application, and not tacked on.

If you plan to gain users because you are in a closed eco-system like the Apple app store or Facebook, then find out the fundamental properties of these eco-systems, and make sure these are part of your app. For example, in the app store, you should cross-promote apps. In facebook, your apps should require more than one person to be useful.

Be very clear on how you want your apps to be discovered. Then build your application around this, otherwise your chance of just being ignored is high.

Have you ever noticed that a lot of the time several asian restaurants will open right next to each other on the same street, instead of in some other “unserviced” part of town? They do that because in order to survive, they need to be discovered, otherwise they will be killed by the great silence.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,6,1,357,7,ARE YOU CAPABLE OF BEING RUTHLESS TO GET AHEAD?,"A few years ago, I was consulting in the technical department of a big company that makes electronics. One day at a company party, a young guy about 24 years old, roughly my age, walked up to me and introduced himself. He was a new recruit and was working in business development. He was funny, charming and intelligent. Over the next 6 months, I would watch him ruthlessly work his way into management, jumping over the heads of people who had been there for years.

I’ll call him Saul and talk a bit about his methods, because they were efficiently effective.

Being ruthless in business is like bringing a gun to a knife fight. People talk about cut-throat business, but actually business is pretty civilised and most people are quite nice to each other. So when a ruthless person comes along who is willing to just charge ahead and throw aside who ever stands in his way, for him it’s like taking candy from a baby. Or to put it in more realistic terms, taking a lot of money from a soft, slightly pudgy nerd.

What I’d like to do is list those external attributes that I observed in Saul – and if you can decide if you would be capable of doing the same to be successful.

1.  **Choose your friends**: Saul always had a lot friends, but he never stayed friends with people who had not moved up in the ranks with him. For example, when I first knew Saul, he was working as an entry-level employee in a large company. He was friends with everyone. He got friendly with the boss, and 6 months later, he was a manager. His old friends said that Saul would walk by them, chatting and laughing with the managers, and it would be like they never existed.

A core of Saul’s strategy, as he once explained was this – you can’t have a million close friends. You need to have close friends that are at your stage in life and higher, and for that, you have to leave the ones that stayed behind back.

When Saul needed something, he made sure that he gained as many friends in that particular area as he could. For example, when he made his play to get into management, he first became friends with his boss, and when his boss took him out, Saul got to know all the other managers, and became their friends.

When Saul wanted to get to know women, he identified the crowd of fun cool guys who were in contact with the women, and he became their friend. Saul would never pretend to be your friend just so you would fix his computer or something short-term like that – he created relationships with the people who would bring him forward.

1.  **Make sure your outwards appearance is perfect**: GTL – Gym, Tan, Laundry. Saul said that people will judge you immediately by your outward appearance, and the most profitable investment you can make is in good clothes, good shoes and a good body. He actually wears light make-up. It may seem vain, but this strategy gained him a lot of attention from women, and he would use women to climb up the ladder of success.

To expand his contacts, he would use his clique of women to gain the attention of the men he was interested in. And for the women to be interested in him, he micro-managed his body and dressing to the smallest details.

And let’s face it – have you seen many top management who look grubby? Being well groomed seems to be an essential attribute of leadership.

1.  **Invest in your location**: Saul spent an extra-ordinary percentage of his income on his home. He lived cheap and spent a large part of his income paying his rent in an expensive area, and furnishing his place really nicely.

One of the most important things he would do then would be to invite people to his home, and when people came in, they would be visibly impressed, and his worth would rise dramatically in their eyes.

Saul also had a network of a few locations he frequented where he knew the people and the staff. At any social gathering, Saul would work to navigate the group to these ‘safe’ territories, where he would then be in control of the situation.

1.  **Approach people and tell them what to do**: Saul had no fear of approaching people and telling them what to do. Rather than sitting in his desk and waiting for things to happen, Saul would always jump at every opportunity to approach someone and either build a relationship with them, or to do something for them.

For example, when new clients were brought on a tour of the company, he stood up and joined the entourage, chatting with the clients. The natural way he did this made it seem normal and accepted, and instantly got him noticed by the Vice President, who was leading the people around the office.

1.  **Keep your head when everyone else is getting caught up in the rush**: Whenever there was a panic or something that required swift action, Saul would always sit back and wait. He would not jump into the fray before he was sure what exactly was going on – which led to the impression that he rarely made mistakes.

On company outings, Saul would drink just a little, while encouraging everyone else to drink an excessive amount. This would result at some point in him taking over control of the group – and this was key to him assuming a de-facto leadership position a few weeks after entering the department.

What this brought him: Saul, shortly after arriving at the company became one of the most popular employees in his department. He was regularly going out for drinks with the head of department, and after a couple of months, she promoted him to something with an office, I’m not sure what.

Then she changed department, and because he had become the de-facto leader of the group, she recommended him for her job. He took over the job, and became close friends with most of the mid-level management. After a couple of months of hard-work, he threatened to transfer to another branch unless he would be promoted. He was promoted after a negotiation period.

Now, five years later I heard he’s running a department with more than a thousand people below him. When people talk about him, they don’t dislike him; they are just awed by the way he aggressively moved ahead. By building relationships, and by ending relationships when they were hampering him, he was able to achieve a lot of what he had told me as he arrived that he wanted to achieve.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,6,1,359,7,DO YOU NEED A CO-FOUNDER?,"Co-founders are both the most important thing that your company needs and the most likely reason your company will fail. If you don’t have any co-founders, when you hit that dip, that speed bump along the road, you will be unable to continue. There will be nobody to talk to, nobody to brainstorm with, nobody who will come up with fresh ideas or new ways of doing things. When the customers are complaining, when you hit an impossible bug, without a co-founder, it is easy to give up or just bury your head in unimportant work.

But with a co-founder, the situation can be even worse. It’s a bit like being married – if the marriage works out well, it’s way better than being single. But if the marriage turns out terrible, being single would be heavenly.

A while back when I was consulting in the DirectX area, I had a client called Eric. He was a soft spoken guy, incredibly nice, but he always had this air of sadness around him. Once, we were chatting in the evening, and he suddenly started telling me his life story. He had been running a software business with a co-founder from college, and the business had just started taking off. Suddenly, his co-founder started acting over-bearing and trying to get Eric to reduce his share of the business. They started fighting, they disagreed on some core features, and at some point, Eric came back home and he could not access the servers. An ugly battle started then that ended with Eric being ousted from the company in exchange for some cash.

The co-founders of small startups have very personal relationships. The line between family, friendship and work blurs completely and they intersect and merge with each other. Flaws in people become magnified when people get that close. Just like the biggest fights can be between brothers, people who have their lives so intertwined can get into big battles about unimportant things.

**HOW CO-FOUNDERS SHOULD BE**
-----------------------------

Imagine you were in some 16th century tavern, having an ale and then a man walks in and says – which of you men here is ready to join me in war, and have your chance at fame and fortune? You will immediately size up the man and decide – can I do battle with this man by my side? Can I follow this man? Can I trust this man? Will this man be smart enough to actually make me achieve fame and fortune, or will he leave me to bleed to death in some field?

A person who instills confidence in you in all of those questions is the person you want to co- found a company with.

And yes, a partnership is never really equal. There has to be someone who is somewhat more equal than others. There is nothing more devastating than a partnership were all the members have exactly equal rights and votes. This just does not work. Human society and all monkeys always have a single individual at the top and with all others, even though they are almost equal, being not quite equal.

Any company where several people believe they should have final say or be consulted on final say is usually going to fail with a bunch of arguments and fights. The partnership may actually work very well in this mode so long no money I’d bring made, but as soon as there is cash, the clashes will start.

There has to be a clear and obvious leader who has final say within every company. That’s just how the big apes roll.

**SO YOU WANT TO START A COMPANY, HUH?**
----------------------------------------

Don’t just go for the obvious co-founder person around you. You may have some guy you know who is somewhat good in IT, this should not be your cofounder just because he lives near you.

Spend some time getting out there and meeting people and finding out who you are compatible with. Form short term collaborations on small projects and websites and see with whom you can work the best. When you want to get serious with a co-founder, make sure you have really worked together for a while.

When you have someone you want to work with, you will know pretty quickly. It’s like meeting the right girl – you know quite quickly this is the person for you. But to find that person, you need to have met a lot of the wrong people first. Few people are lucky enough to meet the right person straight away, or to have the perfect person be your childhood friend.

**PROFESSIONALISM AS A WAY OF DOING THINGS**
--------------------------------------------

Crazy Internet startups where everyone is really chummy with each other are great way to start a company, but it does not scale. Close personal relationships means that people will get into fights, and in small companies, this can be devastating to morale and your productivity. As a company grows, relationships should be formalized. People who are friends should be friends, but people who are not the types likely to be friends should not be forced to do this.

Work should be governed by mutual respect between the people working. It will seem as if the tone of the company is becoming more drab, but taking away the biggest highs also takes away the lowest lows. And the company in the end is there to make money, and this works best when everyone feels comfortable at work, are able to be as quirky as they naturally are without getting in the hair of other people, and has their space to be productive in.

**THE STORY OF ERIC, COMPLETED**
--------------------------------

Eric, after having been kicked out of his company had hired me as a consultant to build his new software. I got a salary to do the code and also to talk with him about the software. He would come up with a business strategy and ask my opinion, and together we designed a good business model.

When the software was done, he said thank you and gave me a nice bonus. He launched the software and now, a few years later, he is one of the biggest players in the media world. I did a lot of follow up work and watched as he basically out-competed his old company to pieces. He took everything he knew from the old company and not only reimplemented it, he fixed the broken parts.

And when the big payout came, he did not have to share with anyone. Last I spoke to him, he has a lovely wife and is quite happy.

Business building is about relationships in no small way. When you start a company, keep that in mind, and choose wisely who you want to be that close to you.",,
7,Mark Essien,markessien,markessien@gmail.com,7,6,1,360,7,EVALUATING STARTUP IDEAS,"The only true currency we humans have is time. Everybody is given a pot of time when they are born, and every day they take out a little from it. One dreaded day, the pot is empty.

People will pay money to have a little more of that precious time. So many modern fortunes have been made with products that save people time, like the automobile or the telephone.

The best way to evaluate the value of a startup is by looking at the value of the time it saves. If it costs $100/hour to produce a screwdriver, and you are able to save 2 hours of that time with a product of yours, then every reasonable company would pay at least $100 to purchase that product.

That is the essence of many software business. Save a business or person some time, so they can go make more money. The value of the time you save is basically the value you can extract for that business.

![Evaluation Framework](https://markessien.com/content/images/2015/11/0-50Gvmue3SqekS13M.png)

The chart above demonstrates this. You can calculate the value your startup creates by filling in the numbers for the chart.

For example, lets look at the chart for the invention of the car. The car significantly increased the speed at which travel could be done. It also did this for something that was done very often (travel) and done by basically everyone. So the value generated by the car was huge.",,

I am here now to share my knowledge with you on what I have learnt and done basically on HTML and what I have been able to accomplish with it withing a very short period of time![](/storage/48/images/img-inhm7q45wt.png)

  

I’m so proud of myself! This time just last week I didn’t know ANYTHING! It’s really amazing what can be achieved in such a short space of time. 

  

but before giving you the icing on the cake I would really love to inform you that so far so good this internship has been fun, exciting, mind blowing and insightful at the same time and I have also been able to help people when they struggle with their task

  

I have been able to use what I have taught on html to create simple things that can be viewed on the browser. And one of the tasks we were given to do is to use HTML to create our personal CV.

  

The picture below shows the result of my CV which was built using html.",,

I must admit, it was pretty tough at first because I never imagined there will be a day when I will use HTML without using CSS. After being familiar with using grids,rows and columns to style pages; using tables was a virgin experience for me and I must say, I am really impressed with myself.

I discovered how to use several attributes in html that could be used for styling without using as in-line styling css or linked css file, amongst them were the font, size, face and valign attributes.

I must admit, it was pretty tough at first because I never imagined there will be a day when I will use HTML without using CSS. After being familiar with using grids,rows and columns to style pages; using tables was a virgin experience for me and I must say, I am really impressed with myself.

I discovered how to use several attributes in html that could be used for styling without using as in-line styling css or linked css file, amongst them were the font, size, face and valign attributes.

I joined up for the **HNG pre-**internship program on Sunday, 18th August 2019, and so far it's been interesting, and challenging. I am still struggling to get used to the deadlines, the workplace at **Slack** and the program as a whole, but one thing is sure, if I do persevere I should be able to come out of this program a better and more refined person. This post is an update on what has been done so far.

·        What I have learnt so far

·        What I wish to still learn

·        Desired Improvements

So here's what my experience has been so far:

**WHAT I HAVE LEARNED**  **SO FAR**

The first thing I learnt networking, how to reach out and communicate with people you have never met before, this was made possible by the Slack application; a collaborative tool for teams to communicate and share ideas. This was my first time hearing about it and using it, so naturally I found it a tad challenging but with the help of the mods/Administrators and very helpful fellow interns I finally got the hang of it. I learnt about linking pages this was part of a task given to us, it did take me a while to figure it, but thankfully I did.

**WHAT I WISH TO LEARN**

I came to learn core programming; Front-end application development and maybe later add Android apps development. I also wish to improve on my social skills; how I communicate with people and build a very productive network filled with intellectuals.

**WHAT I WISH SHOULD BE IMPROVED**

**I feel certain adjustments should be made to the timetable, if classes could be held in the evenings it will bring in a lot of calm and fluidity to the internship scheme. I also wish to suggest a reduction on the amount of site we get to sign up on, some of these sites are not so easy to navigate, leading to wastage of bandwidth.**

           Well there are obvious difficulties with updating the Lucid blog, The tasks are also strange and difficult to follow, I wish the pace can be slowed down a bit so people can follow it. Thanks for reading.",,

Lucky me has found a balance and will keep advancing in that stride. After the completion of the first task, we were introduced to **HTML**, **HTML** stands for **Hypertext Markup Language**. It allows users create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and block quotes for web pages and applications. HTML is not in itself a programming language, but it makes it possible to organize and format documents called HTML documents, similarly to Microsoft Word. HTML documents are files that end with a .**html** or **_.htm _**extension. They can be viewed by using any web browser (Chrome, Uc browser, Opera mini, or Mozilla Firefox). The browser reads the contents of the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users/browsers can view it. Usually, a website is a collection of related pages so using html means one has to create a lot of pages with different HTML content. For instance: home pages download pages, upload pages would all have separate HTML documents.

Now to write or create html documents, you will need an online text editor such as visual studio code, note++, Dreamweaver, Amaya and sublime text 3just to mention a few. I use Visual studio for my HTLM because I found it easy to understand and also because it was recommended. As part of task 2, we were asked to create a web page named after our full name wand with our CV as the content of that single web page, here’s what mine looks like:

This week we started from the very alpha Html. A mark up language used to create what is called the skeleton of any webpage or software's documents to be displayed in a web browser.

###   

### **The difficulty**

Doing this task wasn't particularly difficult; not anywhere near the 'difficulty' of the previous task. In that task, tables were a hassle. HTML tables are great when you need to make tables. When you don't, while powerful, they quickly become confusing. And that's what's great about CSS. You can (technically) order your HTML however you want and then completely transform it with CSS (though, obviously, it's best to keep the order predictable.

  

### **Getting rid of the table**

Was my favourite thing, lol. I couldn't wait to leave that clunky mess and start using proper semantic HTML5 tags. I have so many articles and sections now. And even more headers probably (I'm too lazy to check). And now that the table was gone, I could order the content much more naturally and didn't need placeholder comments for missing cells or rowspans or whatever.

  

### **And the colours!!!** **😍**

Finally, it's no longer a bland, feelingless blob of text. It lives!!

  

### **Results**

After all the madness, I managed to get to this:

![](/storage/455/images/img-afisor9nlo.png)

from this:

![](/storage/455/images/img-z2tyrjyauh.png)

which, in my opinion, is a big improvement.

  

And, another cool thing. I got my HTML down from 167 lines to 124 (that's how bulky the tables were, and I still have so many non-necessary tags for no reason in particular.)

It's so great making something that was previously ugly into something that's much less ugly (dare I say beautiful). And the magic that people can and have done with CSS makes me want to become so much better so that I can one day dazzle millions with the craziest website designs you ever saw (lmao, as if).

###   

### **The difficulty**

Doing this task wasn't particularly difficult; not anywhere near the 'difficulty' of the previous task. In that task, tables were a hassle. HTML tables are great when you need to make tables. When you don't, while powerful, they quickly become confusing. And that's what's great about CSS. You can (technically) order your HTML however you want and then completely transform it with CSS (though, obviously, it's best to keep the order predictable.

  

### **Getting rid of the table**

Was my favourite thing, lol. I couldn't wait to leave that clunky mess and start using proper semantic HTML5 tags. I have so many articles and sections now. And even more headers probably (I'm too lazy to check). And now that the table was gone, I could order the content much more naturally and didn't need placeholder comments for missing cells or rowspans or whatever.

  

### **And the colours!!!** **😍**

Finally, it's no longer a bland, feelingless blob of text. It lives!!

  

### **Results**

After all the madness, I managed to get to this:

from this:

which, in my opinion, is a big improvement.

  

And, another cool thing. I got my HTML down from 167 lines to 124 (that's how bulky the tables were, and I still have so many non-necessary tags for no reason in particular.)

Then year in year out it looks like software is eating the world which only made me more interested but ‘adulting’ took its toll on me with holding a steady but very demanding job in the Quality department of a multinational FMCG company.

Then we also had the twin-time swallower of Youtube and Twitter to deal with, so may hours man, so many hours went there laughing while deep within I was weeping at the hours I could be using to do more productive stuff.

Oh well, that went and ironically while scrolling on Twitter (I keep saying uncool stuff about that website but it really has helped a lot) stumbled on the internship stuff, I registered and here we are so far, keeping late nights after work after some few minutes or hours of Twitter and YouTube to end up writing about my experience of writing codes – _sounds bad-ass when I talk about me coding._

Now here I am learning how to link pages to websites, attach pictures and writing my first bit of code, this is still a bit crude and nothing to be boastful of, but before one becomes a master, we all have to start at zero level and work our way up, that is where I am at the moment, a bit of it is shown below

I decided to put time behind and make it a point of note to actually pay attention to details instead of rushing to submit the task with others.

So far, so good and I pray that God keep the fire burning in me to continue to the end...

In my opinion with regards the current web development settings, there are three foundational languages every web developer should know or have a grasp of. These are HTML, CSS, JS.

HTML - HyperText Markup Language as we know is more or less like the backbone of web development, on which so many other languages, frameworks and the likes rest and those still to come will rest on. Now HTML as popularly described is like the skeleton of the entire web page, assuming a webpage is a building.

Now I'd use this simple analogy imagine a building being built just before painting and everything fancy on it. Would it look nice? **_HELL NO._**

This goes as well for building a web page, a design is needed for beautification of webpages and this is where CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) comes in.

  

Let's take a look at a code sample beneath

HTML - HyperText Markup Language as we know is more or less like the backbone of web development, on which so many other languages, frameworks and the likes rest and those still to come will rest on. Now HTML as popularly described is like the skeleton of the entire web page, assuming a webpage is a building.

Now I'd use this simple analogy imagine a building being built just before painting and everything fancy on it. Would it look nice? **_HELL NO._**

This goes as well for building a web page, a design is needed for beautification of webpages and this is where CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) comes in.

  

Let's take a look at a code sample beneath

As compared to when CSS gets added, there's a form of design introduced. Watch this!

So we got a task from HNG to create an HTML page of our CV without the use of CSS, that is no styling. So work started using tables and its tags , thats what i did. Funny enough this experience really opened my eyes to how tables in HTML work. Part of the task was adding this post with a screenshot but i am glad i did though. Also learnt to use cloudinary which is a service used for hosting images. Pretty neat though. Thanks to HNG for this opportunity..",,

[Start.ng](http://www.start.ng/) has been awesome.

  

On Tuesday, 20th August 2019,  we were introduced to

**HTML** an acronym for **HyperText Markup Language** by **_@SkylarNG89_**. HTML is said to be the structure of the web page. It's used to organize and define how content should be displayed. It is made up of elements which are represented by tags -opening and closing tags. 

  

After the class, I found myself creating the ugliest web page ever.

From my ugly page experience, I made it a habit to close every tag immediately, to avoid forgetting.

  

Thanks to the resources given by the mentors, fellow learners and my only friend that was with me through the night -Google. I was able to do my task which involves creating my CV on a web page. 

  

I used the table element in an attempt to produce the layout of the CV. It was very tasking, almost couldn't keep track of the rows I created but thanks to HTML comments -very important. 

  

During my play with the table element, I was able to add a margin to the web page.

I also discovered that HTML has some text formatting elements such as small, em and strong, etc.

  

And yes, I got to learn about some special characters. &hearts;

**HTML** an acronym for **HyperText Markup Language** by **_@SkylarNG89_**. HTML is said to be the structure of the web page. It's used to organize and define how content should be displayed. It is made up of elements which are represented by tags -opening and closing tags. 

  

After the class, I found myself creating the ugliest web page ever.

From my ugly page experience, I made it a habit to close every tag immediately, to avoid forgetting.

  

Thanks to the resources given by the mentors, fellow learners and my only friend that was with me through the night -Google. I was able to do my task which involves creating my CV on a web page. 

  

I used the table element in an attempt to produce the layout of the CV. It was very tasking, almost couldn't keep track of the rows I created but thanks to HTML comments -very important. 

  

During my play with the table element, I was able to add a margin to the web page.

I also discovered that HTML has some text formatting elements such as small, em and strong, etc.

  

And yes, I got to learn about some special characters. &hearts;

And yes, I got to learn about some special characters. &hearts;

On Tuesday, 20th August 2019,  we were introduced to

**HTML** an acronym for **HyperText Markup Language** by **_@SkylarNG89_**. HTML is said to be the structure of the web page. It's used to organize and define how content should be displayed. It is made up of elements which are represented by tags -opening and closing tags. 

  

After the class, I found myself creating the ugliest web page ever.

From my ugly page experience, I made it a habit to close every tag immediately, to avoid forgetting.

  

Thanks to the resources given by the mentors, fellow learners and my only friend that was with me through the night -Google. I was able to do my task which involves creating my CV on a web page. 

  

I used the table element in an attempt to produce the layout of the CV. It was very tasking, almost couldn't keep track of the rows I created but thanks to HTML comments -very important.

On Tuesday, 20th August 2019,  we were introduced to

**HTML** an acronym for **HyperText Markup Language** by **_@SkylarNG89_**. HTML is said to be the structure of the web page. It's used to organize and define how content should be displayed. It is made up of elements which are represented by tags -opening and closing tags. 

  

After the class, I found myself creating the ugliest web page ever.

From my ugly page experience, I made it a habit to close every tag immediately, to avoid forgetting.

  

Thanks to the resources given by the mentors, fellow learners and my only friend that was with me through the night -Google. I was able to do my task which involves creating my CV on a web page. 

  

I used the table element in an attempt to produce the layout of the CV. It was very tasking, almost couldn't keep track of the rows I created but thanks to HTML comments -very important. 

  

During my play with the table element, I was able to add a margin to the web page.

I also discovered that HTML has some text formatting elements such as small, em and strong, etc.

  

And yes, I got to learn about some special characters. &hearts;

Thanks to the resources given by the mentors, fellow learners and my only friend that was with me through the night -Google. I was able to do my task which involves creating my CV on a web page. 

  

I used the table element in an attempt to produce the layout of the CV. It was very tasking, almost couldn't keep track of the rows I created but thanks to HTML comments -very important. 

  

During my play with the table element, I was able to add a margin to the web page.

I also discovered that HTML has some text formatting elements such as small, em and strong, etc.

  

And yes, I got to learn about some special characters. &hearts;

**HTML** an acronym for **HyperText Markup Language** by **_@SkylarNG89_**. HTML is said to be the structure of the web page. It's used to organize and define how content should be displayed. It is made up of elements which are represented by tags -opening and closing tags.

On Tuesday, 20th August 2019,  we were introduced to

**HTML** an acronym for **HyperText Markup Language** by **_@SkylarNG89_**. HTML is said to be the structure of the web page. It's used to organize and define how content should be displayed. It is made up of elements which are represented by tags -opening and closing tags. 

  

After the class, I found myself creating the ugliest web page ever.

From my ugly page experience, I made it a habit to close every tag immediately, to avoid forgetting.

  

Thanks to the resources given by the mentors, fellow learners and my only friend that was with me through the night -Google. I was able to do my task which involves creating my CV on a web page. 

  

I used the table element in an attempt to produce the layout of the CV. It was very tasking, almost couldn't keep track of the rows I created but thanks to HTML comments -very important. 

  

During my play with the table element, I was able to add a margin to the web page.

I also discovered that HTML has some text formatting elements such as small, em and strong, etc.

  

And yes, I got to learn about some special characters. &hearts;

**HTML** an acronym for **HyperText Markup Language** by **_@SkylarNG89_**. HTML is said to be the structure of the web page. It's used to organize and define how content should be displayed. It is made up of elements which are represented by tags -opening and closing tags. 

  

After the class, I found myself creating the ugliest web page ever.

From my ugly page experience, I made it a habit to close every tag immediately, to avoid forgetting.

  

Thanks to the resources given by the mentors, fellow learners and my only friend that was with me through the night -Google. I was able to do my task which involves creating my CV on a web page. 

  

I used the table element in an attempt to produce the layout of the CV. It was very tasking, almost couldn't keep track of the rows I created but thanks to HTML comments -very important. 

  

During my play with the table element, I was able to add a margin to the web page.

I also discovered that HTML has some text formatting elements such as small, em and strong, etc.

  

And yes, I got to learn about some special characters. &hearts;

I must confess that working with CSS on my website has actually given me the zeal to learn more of scripting languages, CSS has some interesting features that enables you to create user-friendly web page such as margin,background-color,borders,font-family e.t.c

Using CSS with my html has really made me fall in love with my web site, Looking at my CV background color and any other color you can view on my screenshot was done with the help of CSS.

With my experience when using CSS, I can attest to the fact that CSS is much more better than HTML. On this note i recommend that every intending web developer should learn how to use CSS effectively for a better and productive outputs on your web page..

Believe me when i say that the emoji i just tried to post is deceptive . i am actually trying to find a way to insert a crying emoji. I believe i would get around it soon. Talking about things changing, there has just been a lot happening that made the past week look very long.

While HTML would include digging and laying of the foundation, setting of blocks, plastering and attaching windows, door etc, CSS is in-charge of how everything will look like which include color of the house and material, font, position, shine and pattern. I also discovered that even though HTML can function without CSS, it looks shallow and not aesthetic. HTML without CSS is like the map of Africa without Madagascar. 

  

When I first started with the HTML, the resume looks horrible and the layout seem off, then i applied CSS synthases like position, margin, padding etc. And with CSS, I discovered that it more of an art that science, the more you try, the more it looks better and later realized that maybe you have overdone the design. Note to self to read up on design pattern articles and maybe explore some videos on youtube.

While HTML would include digging and laying of the foundation, setting of blocks, plastering and attaching windows, door etc, CSS is in-charge of how everything will look like which include color of the house and material, font, position, shine and pattern. I also discovered that even though HTML can function without CSS, it looks shallow and not aesthetic. HTML without CSS is like the map of Africa without Madagascar. 

  

When I first started with the HTML, the resume looks horrible and the layout seem off, then i applied CSS synthases like position, margin, padding etc. And with CSS, I discovered that it more of an art that science, the more you try, the more it looks better and later realized that maybe you have overdone the design. Note to self to read up on design pattern articles and maybe explore some videos on youtube.

1134,Martini Mabifa,martinimabifa,martinimabifa@gmail.com,1134,7,1,63,1134,HTML Course so far on startdotng,"On Start.ng I have learnt the HTML document structure. The structuring of a Html page consists of the following:

*   DIVs which are block-level elements (block-level elements begin on a new line, stacking on top of each other and take up any available width) while SPANs are inline-level elements (inline level elements follow the normal document flow and only take up the width of their content). 
*   The major sections of pages include the head, body(Artcile, Section and Aside) and the footer
*   IDs and Classes which are attributes used in identifying and grouping elements when styling 
*   Forms which are used to receive information of the website. It includes input fields with types depending on the type of data needed.
*   Tags are used to define specific elements e.g the body tags which defines the body of the html document etc
*   It is very IMPORTANT to close tags after opening them except incases of tags that dont need a close tag e.g the image tag
*   Comments are important in writing HTML code just so another person finds it easier to read and understand your code

Learning HTML during this HNG internship programs has allowed to know more about the language and it has also introduced me to new tags and attributes used in the language. The assignment to format our resume in HTML also brought clarity to the usage of some of these tags. Although it took a while to get my hand wrapped around some methodologies, it however was an experience that I totally enjoyed.

  

I have however realized from this training that there are several ways to achieve a task but some routes are better and with the help of some of the mentors and class members, it was a hitch-free journey to coding my first script.

  

Some of the things I learnt was format each heading with different sizes with the <h>, assigning information to paragraphs with <p> tag, the <li> tag was used to list items in the HTML page, the table tag was used to arrange information in a table arrangement and how to aesthetically arrange the codes to easily review it.

Learning HTML during this HNG internship programs has allowed to know more about the language and it has also introduced me to new tags and attributes used in the language. The assignment to format our resume in HTML also brought clarity to the usage of some of these tags. Although it took a while to get my hand wrapped around some methodologies, it however was an experience that I totally enjoyed.

**_First task on HTML - cv write up._**

  

First I must say that it's a new learning curve and one am proud of having to stick to the guns and see this through. I learnt alot with regards to elements, in line and block, the building of tables, went ahead to also learn the inserting of <strong> / </strong> elements to achieve a bold letter or word and the <em> / </em> the emphasize to achieve the italic design.

  

The whole process truly is opening my eyes as to the loads and loads of work that's in this field, one that I'd brace myself up to and one that I'd be willing to embark on. **_A journey of a thousand miles, they say begins with a step_** 😀- And mine has just begun.

You would most like very quickly go straight to your Android or iOS mobile device, search for [hotels.ng](https://hotels.ng/hotels-in-abuja) on Google and get the exact information you need.

Well, this is made possible by the World Wide Web or the abbreviation W.W.W. What you probably didn’t know is that at the core of the World Wide Web is HTML.

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is a standard markup language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page with a series of elements. These elements are represented by <tags>.

Let’s take a look at HTML terms before we go straight into creating a simple CV.

Elements

As said earlier, elements define the structure and contents of the objects of a web page and are enclosed in <angel bracket>, for instance:

·        The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5

·        The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page

·        The <head> element contains meta information about the document

·        The <title> element specifies a title for the document

·        The <body> element contains the visible page content

·        The <h1> element defines a large heading, also h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6 defines smaller headings

·        The <p> element defines a paragraph.

·        The <strong> elements defines a **Bold** text.

·        The list goes on and on.

Tags

An element surrounded by angel bracket makes it a tag. HTML tags are typically written in pairs, the start or opening tag <h1> and the end or closing tag </h1>. The difference being that the end tag has a forward slash.

It is very important to start and end your tags for the web browser to completely understand what you have written. However, some tags are self-closing like the image tag <img>and the single break line tag <br>.

  

Attributes

Attributes are mostly defined with an opening tag and they provide more information about an element. They comprise of a name and a value. For example \*<a href=”[https://start.ng](https://start.ng/)”>Start NG</a>\*

<a> is the name, the href attribute contains a value which is the link you to another web page or content within a page.

This task has taught me that, (1)Ther are much more han one way to achieve a certain laid out goal, all that's required is perseverance and determination (2)My blood is going to start pumping faster than usual and i should keep it that way because that just means i want to be better (3) Doubt is a constant, and most of the time, i have just wanted to close my laptop and bury it, but it judges me and then i pick it up and feel great again. It's a love that wont let go.and Lastly, for now,(4) Google is the ultimate uncoditional friend that would never shame me for not knowing what i'm supposed to know and show me steps of the way how to be amazing at what i know i can be at.

Because I had to read several notes and watch several videos at first. These videos is actually worth it. I believe that this training is my foundation on programming and learning digital marketing and front-end programming.

We used html 5, which is the latest standard of its version. We were able to build a web page/web site using only html (that is without using CSS or JS). Emphasis where made on closing tags as it is key if a document is written correctly. Startng made us to understand that the best way to learn is to practice as well. Using the “Visual Studio code”, I was able to design a web site/page successfully today, which the screen short of my work is attached here below.

The screen short of the web page designed is shown below:

I want to dive deep into machine learning and mobile application development. I also look out for opportunity to meet more people and learn as much as possible from the pool of talents.

So far so good at HNG internship, I think the admin's and moderators are just the best at it, however there is room for improvement on their communication and people management skills.

It appears HNG internship has no time table, the admins and moderators are very poor when it comes to time management, keeping to time and timelines.

So far i have cone to understand some basics in HTML...let me take you through briefly.

...

First things first, what's HTML.

Hypertext Markup Language. (html) is an essential part of website development.

**_Basically Html +CSS = website_**_._

Html makes up the basics structure of a webpage and its makes specially programming tools in its execution. This includes elements, tags, attributes etc. All this tools work and in hand e.g an element (heading or paragraph) must be accompanied by a opening and closing tag (<, >)

**Elements:** common elements include heading and paragraph. Their are symbolized with d h and p respectively. Headings range from h1 to h6.

**Tag**: tags are used to give an element meaning when writing codes. Meaning an element MUST have an opening an a closing tag e.g a heading will appear <h> and </h> for opening and closing tags respectively while a paragraph will also be written in similar forms.

I have learnt several other ways of using the html and i am gradually mastering the tool( one step at a time though time as not been friendly). Here is a sample of my work, its just a simple aspect and still in progress. I will show you as it grows.

I have learned a lot about HTML in my short period with the class on slack. HTMl being the backbone of every website is very essential to know before moving on to other technologies in web development.

We learned a lot about HTML, enough for me to make a simple CV document using just HTML. I utilised different tags we learned about in the classes. Tags such as: Header tags, Paragraph tags, Div tags, List tags (both ordered and unordered tags) were used to accomplish this simple web page.

This project has helped me to understand how each tag is interpreted by the browser; how the paragraph tag is given more space than the small tag and so forth. I also made sure I divided each section of the CV into div sections in the HTML code to give it easy readability.

Here is cheers to learning more and doing more.

I remain,

Yours in insight,
